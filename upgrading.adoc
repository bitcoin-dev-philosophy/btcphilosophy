== Upgrading

image::upgrading-banner.jpg[]

Upgrading Bitcoin in a safe way can be extremely difficult. Some
changes take several years to roll out. In this chapter, we learn
about the common vocabulary around upgrading Bitcoin, and explore some
examples of historic upgrades to its protocol as well as the insights that we gained
from them. Finally, we talk about chain splits and the risks and costs 
related to them.

To get in tune for this chapter, you should read
https://bitcointalk.org/dec/p1.html[David Harding's piece on harmony
and discord].

[quote, David Harding, Harmony and Discord]
____
Bitcoin experts talk often of consensus, whose meaning is abstract and
hard to pin down. But the word consensus evolved from the Latin word
concentus, "a singing together,
harmony,"[1] so let us talk
not of Bitcoin consensus but of Bitcoin harmony.

Harmony is what makes Bitcoin work. Thousands of full nodes each work
independently to verify the transactions they receive are valid,
producing a harmonious agreement about the state of the Bitcoin ledger
without any node operator needing to trust anyone else. It's similar
to a chorus where each member sings the same song at the same time to
produce something far more beautiful than any of them could produce
alone.

The result of Bitcoin harmony is a system where bitcoins are safe not
just from petty thieves (provided you keep your keys secure) but also
from endless inflation, mass or targeted confiscation, or simply the
bureaucratic morass that is the legacy financial system.
____

This chapter discusses how Bitcoin can be upgraded without causing
discord. Staying in harmony, i.e. maintaining consensus, is indeed one of the biggest
challenges in Bitcoin development. There are lots of nuances to
upgrade mechanisms, which might be best understood by studying actual cases of
previous upgrades. For this reason, the chapter puts much focus on historic examples, and
it starts by setting the stage with some useful vocabulary.

=== Vocabulary

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/077f7e1f
----

According to Wikipedia,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_compatibility[_forward
compatibility_]
refers to the condition in which an old software can process data
created by newer softwares, ignoring the parts it doesn't understand.

[quote, Forward compatibility, Wikipedia]
____
A standard supports forward compatibility if a product that complies
with earlier versions can "gracefully" process input designed for
later versions of the standard, ignoring new parts which it does not
understand.
____

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/30edaffc
----

Vice versa,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility[_backward
compatibility_] refers to when data from an old software is usable
on newer
softwares. A change is said to be fully compatible if it's both forward
and backward compatible.

A change to the Bitcoin consensus rules is said to be a *soft fork* if
it is fully compatible. This is the most common way to upgrade
Bitcoin, for a number of reasons that we'll discuss further in this
chapter. If a change to the Bitcoin consensus rules is backward
compatible but not forward compatible, it is called a *hard fork*.

For a technical overview of soft forks and hard forks, please read
https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-11.html[chapter 11 of
Grokking Bitcoin]. It explains these terms and also dives into the
upgrade mechanisms. It's recommended, although not strictly
necessary, to get a grip on this before you continue reading.

=== Historic upgrades

Bitcoin is not the same today as it was when the genesis block was
created. Several upgrades have been made throughout the years. In 2017, Eric
Lombrozo
https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/changing-consensus-rules-without-breaking-bitcoin/[spoke
at the Breaking Bitcoin conference]
about Bitcoin's different upgrading mechanisms, pointing out how much they
have evolved over time. He even explained how Satoshi Nakamoto
once upgraded Bitcoin through a hard fork.

//noqr
[quote, Eric Lombrozo, Changing Consensus Rules Without Breaking Bitcoin at Breaking Bitcoin conference (2017)]
____
There was actually a hard-fork in bitcoin that Satoshi did that we
would never do it this way- it’s a pretty bad way to do it. If you
look at the git commit description here
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/757f0769d8360ea043f469f3a35f6ec204740446[757f076]],
he says something about reverted makefile.unix wx-config version
0.3.6. Right. That’s all it says. It has no indication that it has a
breaking change at all. He was basically hiding it in there. He also
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=626.msg6451#msg6451[posted to
bitcointalk] and said, please upgrade to 0.3.6 ASAP. We fixed an
implementation bug where it is possible that bogus transactions can be
displayed as accepted. Do not accept bitcoin payments until you
upgrade to 0.3.6. If you can’t upgrade right away, then it would be
best to shutdown your bitcoin node until you do. And then on top of
that, I don’t know why he decided to do this as well, he decided to
add some optimizations in the same code. Fix a bug and add some
optimizations.

He points out that, be it intentionally or not, this hard fork created
opportunities for future soft forks, namely the Script operators
(opcodes) OP_NOP1-OP_NOP10. We'll look more into this
code change in <<cve-2010-5141>>. These opcodes have
been used for two soft
forks so far:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki[BIP65]
(OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY), and
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki[BIP113]
(OP_SEQUENCEVERIFY).

Lombrozo also provides an overview of the way upgrade mechanisms have evolved
throughout the years, up until 2017. Since then, only one other
major upgrade, Taproot (analyzed in <<taproot-deployment>>),
has been deployed. The long and somewhat chaotic process that led to its activation has helped us gain further insights on upgrading mechanisms in Bitcoin.

[[segwit-upgrade]]
==== Segwit upgrade

While all the upgrades preceding Segwit had been more or less
painless, this one was different. When Segwit activation code was released, in October 2016, there seemed to be overwhelming
support for it among Bitcoin users, but for some reason miners
didn't signal support for this upgrade, which stalled the activation
with no resolution in sight.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/9ce32dab

Aaron van Wirdum describes this winding road in his Bitcoin Magazine
article
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-long-road-to-segwit-how-bitcoins-biggest-protocol-upgrade-became-reality[The
Long Road To Segwit]. He starts by explaining what Segwit is and how
that taps into the block size debate. Van Wirdum then outlines the
turn of events that led to its final activation. At the center of
this process was an upgrade mechanism called _user activated soft
fork_, or UASF for short, that was proposed by user Shaolinfry.

[quote, Aaron van Wirdum, The Long Road To Segwit on Bitcoin Magazine (2017)]
____
Shaolinfry proposed an alternative: a user activated soft fork
(UASF). Instead of hash power activation, a user activated soft fork
would have a “‘flag day activation’ where nodes begin enforcement at a
predetermined time in the future.” As long as such a UASF is enforced
by an economic majority, this should compel a majority of miners to
follow (or activate) the soft fork.
____

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/99a5f82f
----

Among other things, he cites Shaolinfry's email to the Bitcoin-dev
mailing list. In that occasion Shaolinfry
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013643.html[argued
against miner activated soft forks], listing a number of problems
with them.

[quote, Shaolinfry, Bitcoin-dev mailing list (2017)]
____
Firstly, it requires trusting the hash power will validate after activation. 
The BIP66 soft fork was a case where 95% of the hashrate was signaling 
readiness but in reality about half was not actually validating the upgraded 
rules and mined upon an invalid block by mistake[1].

Secondly, miner signalling has a natural veto which allows a small percentage 
of hashrate to veto node activation of the upgrade for everyone. To date, soft 
forks have taken advantage of the relatively centralised mining landscape where 
there are relatively few mining pools building valid blocks; as we move towards 
more hashrate decentralization, it's likely that we will suffer more and more 
from "upgrade inertia" which will veto most upgrades.
____

Shaolinfry also drew attention to a common misinterpretation of miner signaling: people generally
thought that it was a means by which miners could decide upon protocol upgrades, rather than an action that helped
coordinate upgrades. Due to this misunderstanding, miners might have also felt
obliged to proclaim in public their views on a certain soft fork, as if that
gave weight to the proposal.

The UASF proposal is, in a nutshell, a "`flag day`" on which nodes
start enforcing specific new rules. That way, miners don't have to
make a collective effort to coordinate the upgrade, but _can_ trigger activation
earlier than the flag day if enough blocks signal support.

[quote, Shaolinfry, Bitcoin-dev mailing list (2017)]
____
My suggestion is to have the best of both worlds. Since a user
activated soft fork needs a relatively long lead time before
activation, we can combine with BIP9 to give the option of a faster
hash power coordinated activation or activation by flag day, whichever
is the sooner. In both cases, we can leverage the warning systems in
BIP9. The change is relatively simple, adding an activation-time
parameter which will transition the BIP9 state to LOCKED_IN before the
end of the BIP9 deployment timeout.

This idea caught a lot of interest, but didn't seem to reach near
unanimous support, which caused concern for a potential chain
split. The article by Aaron van Wirdum explains how this finally got
resolved thanks to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0091.mediawiki[BIP91],
authored by James Hilliard.

[quote, Aaron van Wirdum, The Long Road To Segwit on Bitcoin Magazine (2017)]
____
Hilliard proposed a slightly complex but clever solution that would
make everything compatible: Segregated Witness activation as proposed
by the Bitcoin Core development team, the BIP148 UASF and the New York
Agreement activation mechanism. His BIP91 could keep Bitcoin whole —
at least throughout SegWit activation.
____

There were some more complicating factors involved (e.g. the so-called
"New York Agreement"), that this BIP had to take into consideration.
We encourage you to read Van Wirdum's article in full to learn about
the many interesting details in this story.

==== Post-Segwit discussion

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/4854f768
----

After the Segwit deployment, a discussion about deployment mechanisms
emerged. As noted by Eric Lombrozo in
https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/changing-consensus-rules-without-breaking-bitcoin/[his
talk at the Breaking Bitcoin conference]
and by
Shaolinfry (see <<segwit-upgrade>> above), a miner activated soft fork isn't the ideal upgrade
mechanism.

[quote, Eric Lombrozo, Changing Consensus Rules Without Breaking Bitcoin at Breaking Bitcoin conference (2017)]
____
At some point we’re probably going to want to add more features to the
bitcoin protocol. This is a big philosophical question we’re asking
ourselves. Do we do a UASF for the next one? What about a hybrid
approach? Miner activated by itself has been ruled out. bip9 we’re not
going to use again.

In January 2020, Matt Corallo
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html[sent
an email] to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list that started a discussion on
future soft fork deployment mechanisms. He listed five goals that he
thought were essential in an upgrade. David Harding
https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/01/15/#discussion-of-soft-fork-activation-mechanisms[summarizes
them in a Bitcoin Optech newsletter] as:

[quote, David Harding, Bitcoin Optech newsletter #80 (2020)]
____
. The ability to abort if a serious objection to the proposed
consensus rules changes is encountered
. The allocation of enough time after the release of updated software
to ensure that most economic nodes are upgraded to enforce those rules
. The expectation that the network hash rate will be roughly the same
before and after the change, as well as during any transition
. The prevention, as much as possible, of the creation of blocks that
are invalid under the new rules, which could lead to false
confirmations in non-upgraded nodes and SPV clients
. The assurance that the abort mechanisms can’t be misused by griefers
or partisans to withhold a widely desired upgrade with no known
problems
____

What Corallo proposes is a combination of a miner activated soft fork
and a user activated soft fork:

[quote, Matt Corallo, Modern Soft Fork Activation on Bitcoin-dev mailing list (2020)]
____
Thus, as something a bit more concrete, I think an activation method
which sets the right precedent and appropriately considers the above
goals, would be:

1) a standard BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for
activation with 95% miner readiness, +
2) in the case that no activation occurs within a year, a six month
quieting period during which the community can analyze and discussion
the reasons for no activation and, +
3) in the case that it makes sense, a simple command-line/bitcoin.conf
parameter which was supported since the original deployment release
would enable users to opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month
time-horizon for flag-day activation (as well as a new Bitcoin Core
release enabling the flag universally).

This provides a very long time horizon for more standard activation,
while still ensuring the goals in #5 are met, even if, in those cases,
the time horizon needs to be significantly extended to meet the goals of
#3. Developing Bitcoin is not a race. If we have to, waiting 42 months
ensures we're not setting a negative precedent that we'll come to regret
as Bitcoin continues to grow.

[[taproot-deployment]]
==== Taproot upgrade - Speedy Trial

When Taproot was ready for deployment in October 2020, meaning all the technical details
around its consensus rules had been implemented and had reached broad
approval within the community, discussions on how to actually deploy it
started to heat up. These discussions had been pretty low key up until
that point.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/9a35bb28
----

Lots of proposals for activation mechanisms started floating around, and
David Harding
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals[summarized
them on the Bitcoin Wiki]. In his article he explained some properties
of BIP8, which at that time had some recent changes made in order to make it
more flexible.

//noqr
[quote, David Harding, Taproot Activation Proposals on the Bitcoin Wiki (2020)]
____
At the time this document is being written,
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki[BIP8]
has been drafted based on lessons learned in 2017. One notable change
following BIPs 9+148 is that forced activation is now based on block
height rather than median time past; a second notable change is that
forced activation is a boolean parameter chosen when a soft fork’s
activation parameters are set either for the initial deployment or
updated in a later deployment.

//noqr
BIP8 without forced activation is very similar to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki[BIP9]
version bits with timeout and delay, with the only significant
difference being BIP8’s use of block heights compared to BIP9’s use of
median time past. This setting allows the attempt to fail (but it can
be retried later).

BIP8 with forced activation concludes with a mandatory signaling
period where all blocks produced in compliance with its rules must
signal readiness for the soft fork in a way that will trigger
activation in an earlier deployment of the same soft fork with
non-mandatory activation. In other words, if node version x is
released without forced activation and, later, version y is released
that successfully forces miners to begin signaling readiness within
the same time period, both versions will begin enforcing the new
consensus rules at the same time.

This flexibility of the revised BIP8 proposal makes it possible to
express some other ideas in terms of what they would look like using
BIP8. This provides a common factor to use for categorizing many
different proposals.
____

From this point forward the discussions became very heated, especially
around whether `lockinontimeout` should be `true` (as in a user
activated soft fork, referred to as "`BIP8 with forced activation`" by
Harding) or `false` (as in a miner activated soft fork, referred to as
"`BIP8 without forced activation`" by Harding).

Among the proposals listed, one of them was titled "`Let’s see what
happens`". For some reason, this proposal didn't get much traction
until seven months later.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/0dbff39a
----

During those seven months, the discussion went on and it seemed like
there was no way to reach broad consensus over which deployment
mechanism to use. There were mainly two camps: one that preferred
`lockinontimeout=true` (the UASF crowd) and the other one that preferred
`lockinontimeout=false` (the "`try and if it fails rethink`" crowd). Since
there was no overwhelming support for any of these options, the
debate went in circles with seemingly no way forward. Some of
these discussions were held on IRC, in a channel called
##taproot-activation, but
https://gnusha.org/taproot-activation/2021-03-05.log[on March 5th 2021],
something changed:

[quote, #taproot-activation IRC log]
____
....
06:42 < harding> roconnor: is somebody proposing BIP8(3m, false)?  I mentioned that the other day but I didn't see any responses.
 [...]
06:43 < willcl_ark_> Amusingly, I was just thinking to myself that, vs this, the SegWit activation was actually pretty straightforward: simply a LOT=false and if it fails a UASF.
06:43 < maybehuman> it's funny, "let's see what happens" (i.e. false, 3m) was a poular choice right at the beginning of this channel iirc
06:44 < roconnor> harding: I think I am.  I don't know how much that is worth.  Mostly I think it would be a widely acceptable configuration based on my understanding of everyone's concerns.
06:44 < willcl_ark_> maybehuman: becuase everybody actually wants this, even miners reckoned they could upgrade in about two weeks (or at least f2pool said that)
06:44 < roconnor> harding: BIP8(3m,false) with an extended lockin-period.
06:45 < harding> roconnor: oh, good.  It's been my favorite option since I first summarized the options on the wiki like seven months ago.
06:45 <@michaelfolkson> UASF wouldn't release (true,3m) but yeah Core could release (false, 3m)
06:45 < willcl_ark_> harding: It certainly seems like a good approach to me. _if_ that fails, then you can try an understand why, without wasting too much time
....

https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/a20ca180

The "`let's see what happens`" approach finally seemed to click in
peoples`' minds. This process would later be labeled as "`Speedy Trial`"
due to its short signaling period. David Harding explains this idea
to the broader community in an
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html[email
to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list].

[quote, David Harding on Bitcoin-dev mailing list]
____
The earlier version of this proposal was documented over 200 days ago[3]
and taproot's underlying code was merged into Bitcoin Core over 140 days
ago.[4]  If we had started Speedy Trial at the time taproot
was merged (which is a bit unrealistic), we would've either be less than
two months away from having taproot or we would have moved on to the
next activation attempt over a month ago.

Instead, we've debated at length and don't appear to be any closer to
what I think is a widely acceptable solution than when the mailing list
began discussing post-segwit activation schemes over a year ago.[5]  I
think Speedy Trial is a way to generate fast progress that will either
end the debate (for now, if activation is successful) or give us some
actual data upon which to base future taproot activation proposals.
____

//noqr
This deployment mechanism was refined over the course of two months
and then released in
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.21.1.md#taproot-soft-fork[Bitcoin
Core version 0.21.1]. The miners quickly started signaling for this
upgrade moving the deployment state to `LOCKED_IN`, and after a grace
period the Taproot rules were activated mid-November 2021 in block
https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000687bca986194dc2c1f949318629b44bb54ec0a94d8244[709632].

==== Future deployment mechanisms

Given the problems with the recent soft forks, Segwit and Taproot,
it's not clear how the next upgrade will be deployed. Speedy Trial was
used to deploy Taproot, but it was used to bridge the chasm between
the UASF and the MASF crowds, not because it has emerged as the best
known deployment mechanism.

[[upgrading-risks]]
=== Risks

During the activation of any fork, be it hard or soft, miner activated or user
activated, there's the risk of a long-lasting chain split. A split that
lingers for more than a few blocks can cause severe damage to the
sentiment around Bitcoin as well as to its price. But above all, it
would cause great confusion over what Bitcoin is. Is Bitcoin this
chain or that chain?

The risk with a user activated soft fork is that the new rules get
activated even if the majority of the hash power doesn't support
them. This scenario would result in a long-lasting chain split, which
would persist until the majority of the hash power adopts the new
rules. It could be especially hard to incentivize miners to switch to
the new chain if they had already mined blocks after the split on the
old chain, because by switching branch they would be abandoning their
own block rewards. However, it's worth mentioning a remarkable episode: in March 2013
a long-lasting split, explained in <<march2013split>>, occurred due to an
unintentional hard fork and, contrary to this incentive, two major mining pools made the decision to
abandon their branch of the split in order to restore consensus.

On the other hand, the risk with a miner activated soft fork is a consequence of the fact that miners can engage
in false signaling, which means that the actual share of the hash
power that supports the change could be smaller than it looks. If the actual
support doesn't comprise a majority of the hash power, we'd probably
see a long-lasting chain split similar to the one described in the
previous paragraph. This, or at least a similar issue, has happened in
reality when BIP66 was deployed (see <<bip66-splits>>), but it got resolved
within 6 blocks or so.

==== Costs of a split

Jimmy Song
https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/socialized-costs-of-hard-forks/[spoke
about the costs associated with hard forks] at Breaking Bitcoin in
Paris, but much of what he said applies to a chain split due to a failed soft
fork as well. He spoke about _negative externalities_, and defined them as the
price someone else has to pay for your own actions.

[quote, Jimmy Song, Socialized Costs Of Hard Forks at Breaking Bitcoin conference (2017)]
____
The classic example of a negative externality is a factory. Maybe they
are producing– maybe it’s an oil refinery and they produce a good that
is good for the economy but they also produce something that is a
negative externality, like pollution. It’s not just something that
everyone has to pay for, to clean up, or suffer from. But it’s also
2nd and 3rd order effects, like more traffic going towards the factory
as a result of more workers that need to go there. You might also
have- you might endanger some wildlife around there. It’s not that
everyone has to pay for the negative externalities, it might be
specific people, like people who were previously using that road or
animals that were near that factory, and they are also paying for the
cost of that factory.
____

In the context of Bitcoin, he exemplifies negative externalities using
Bitcoin Cash (bcash), which is a hard fork of Bitcoin created shortly
prior to that conference in 2017. He categorizes the negative externalities of
a hard fork into one-time costs and permanent costs.

Among the many examples of one-time costs, he mentions the ones incurred by exchanges.

[quote, Jimmy Song, Socialized Costs Of Hard Forks at Breaking Bitcoin conference (2017)]
____
So we have a bunch of exchanges and they had a lot of one-time costs
that they had to pay. The first thing that happened is that deposits
and withdrawals had to be halted for a day or two for these exchanges
because they didn’t know what would happen. Many of these exchanges
had to dip into cold storage because their users were demanding
bcash. It’s part of their fidicuiary duty, they have to do that. You
also have to audit the new software. This is something that we had to
do at itbit. We want to spend bcash- how do we do it? We have to
download electron cash? Does it have malware? We have to go and
audit it. We had like 10 days to figure out if this was okay
or not. And then you have to decide, are we going to just allow a
one-time withdrawal, or are we going to list this new coin? For an
exchange to lis ta new coin, it’s not easy- there’s all sorts of new
procedures for cold storage, signing, deposits, withdrawals. Or you
could just have this one-off event where you give them their bcash at
some point and then you never think about it again. But that has its
problems too. And finally, and whatever way you do it, withdrawals or
listing– you are going to need new infrastructure to work with this
token in some way, even if it’s a one-time withdrawal. You need some
way to give these tokens to your users. Again, short-notice. Right? No
time to do this, has to be done quickly.
____

He also lists the one-time costs incurred by merchants, payment processors,
wallets, miners, and users, as well as some of the permanent costs,
for example privacy loss and a higher risk of reorgs.

Indeed, when a split happens and the chain with the most general
rules becomes stronger than the chain with the stricter rules, a reorg
will occur. This will have a severe impact on all transactions carried
out in the wiped-out branch. For these reasons it's really important
to try avoiding chain splits at all times.

=== Conclusion

Bitcoin grows and evolves with time. Different upgrade mechanisms
have been used over the years and the learning curve is steep. More
and more sophisticated and robust methods keep being invented, as we
learn more about how the network reacts.

To keep Bitcoin in harmony, soft forks have proven to be the way
forward, but the big question is still not fully answered: how do we
safely deploy soft forks without causing discord?
