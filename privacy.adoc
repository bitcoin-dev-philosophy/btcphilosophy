== Privacy

image::privacy-banner.jpg[]

This chapter deals with how to keep your private financial information
to yourself. It explains what privacy stands for in the context of Bitcoin,
why it's important, and what it means to say that Bitcoin is
pseudonymous. It also looks into how private data can leak, both on-chain
and off-chain. Then, it talks about the fact that bitcoins should be
fungible, meaning interchangeable for any other bitcoins, and how
fungibility and privacy go hand in hand. Lastly, the chapter introduces some
measures you can take to improve your privacy and that of others.

Bitcoin can be described as a pseudonymous system (see
<<pseudonymity>> for further details on this), where users have multiple pseudonyms in the
form of public keys. At first glance, this looks like a pretty good
way to protect users from being identified, but it is in fact really
easy to leak private financial information unintentionally.

=== What does privacy mean?

Privacy can mean different things in different contexts. In
Bitcoin, it generally means that users don't have to reveal their
financial information to others, unless they voluntarily do so.

There are many ways in which you may leak your private information
to others, with or without knowing it. Data can either leak from the
public blockchain or through other means, for example when malicious actors intercept
your internet communications.

It may seem obvious why privacy is important in Bitcoin, but there are
some aspects of it that one might not immediately think about.
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908[On
the Bitcoin Talk forum], Gregory
Maxwell walks us through a lot of good reasons why he
thinks privacy matters. Among them are free market, safety, and human
dignity:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Talk forum (2013)]
____
Financial privacy is an essential criteria for the efficient operation
of a free market: if you run a business, you cannot effectively set
prices if your suppliers and customers can see all your transactions
against your will. You cannot compete effectively if your competition
is tracking your sales.  Individually your informational leverage is
lost in your private dealings if you don't have privacy over your
accounts: if you pay your landlord in Bitcoin without enough privacy
in place, your landlord will see when you've received a pay raise and
can hit you up for more rent.

Financial privacy is essential for personal safety: if thieves can see
your spending, income, and holdings, they can use that information to
target and exploit you. Without privacy malicious parties have more
ability to steal your identity, snatch your large purchases off your
doorstep, or impersonate businesses you transact with towards
you... they can tell exactly how much to try to scam you for.

Financial privacy is essential for human dignity: no one wants the
snotty barista at the coffee shop or their nosy neighbors commenting
on their income or spending habits. No one wants their baby-crazy
in-laws asking why they're buying contraception (or sex toys). Your
employer has no business knowing what church you donate to. Only in a
perfectly enlightened discrimination free world where no one has undue
authority over anyone else could we retain our dignity and make our
lawful transactions freely without self-censorship if we don't have
privacy.
____

Maxwell also touches on fungibility, which will be discussed <<fungibility,later in
this chapter>>, as well as on how privacy and law enforcement are not
contradictory.

[[pseudonymity]]
=== Pseudonymity

We mentioned above that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, and that the
pseudonyms are public keys. In the media you often hear
that Bitcoin is anonymous, which is not correct. There is a
distinction between anonymity and pseudonymity.

Andrew Poelstra
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/29473/69518[explains in a Bitcoin
Stack Exchange post] what anonymity would look like in transactions:

[quote,Andrew Poelstra on anonymity,Bitcoin Stack Exchange (2016)]
____
Total anonymity, in the sense that when you spend money there is no
trace of where it came from or where it's going, is theoretically
possible by using the cryptographic technique of zero-knowledge
proofs.
____

The difference seems to be that in a pseudonymous form of money you can
trace payments between pseudonyms, whereas in an anonymous form of money you
can't. Since bitcoin payments are traceable between pseudonyms, it's
not an anonymous system.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/6960ad66
----

We have also said that the pseudonyms are public keys, but it's
actually addresses derived from public keys. Why do we use addresses
as pseudonyms and not something else, for example some descriptive
names, like "`watchme1984`"? This has been
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/25175/69518[explained well] by
user Tim S., also on Bitcoin Stack Exchange:

[quote,Tim S. on pseudonyms,Bitcoin Stack Exchange (2014)]
____
In order for Bitcoin's idea to work, you must have coins that can only
be spent by the owner of a given private key. This means that whatever
you send to must be tied, in some way, to a public key.

Using arbitrary pseudonyms (e.g. user names) would mean that you'd
have to then somehow link the pseudonym to a public key in order to
enable public/private key crypto. This would remove the ability to
securely create addresses/pseudonyms offline (e.g. before someone
could send money to the user name "tdumidu", you'd have to announce in
the blockchain that "tdumidu" is owned by public key "a1c...", and
include a fee so others have a reason to announce it), reduce
anonymity (by encouraging you to reuse pseudonyms), and needlessly
bloat the size of the blockchain. It would also create a false sense
of security that you're sending to who you think you are (if I take
the name "Linus Torvalds" before he does, then it's mine and people
might send money thinking they're paying the creator of Linux, not
me).
____

By using addresses, or public keys, we achieve important goals, such as removing the need to somehow register
a pseudonym beforehand, reducing the incentives for pseudonym reuse, avoiding
blockchain bloat, and making it harder to impersonate other people.

[[blockchainprivacy]]
=== Blockchain privacy

Blockchain privacy refers to the information you disclose by
transacting on the blockchain. It applies to all transactions,
the ones you send as well as the ones you receive.

Satoshi Nakamoto ponders over on-chain privacy in section 7 of his
https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin whitepaper]:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008)]
____
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each
transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some
linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The
risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal
other transactions that belonged to the same owner.
____

The paper summarizes the main problems of blockchain privacy, namely address
reuse and address clustering. The first is self-explaining, the latter refers to the ability to decide,
with some level of certainty, that a set of different addresses belongs
to the same user.

Chris Belcher
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy[wrote in
great detail] about the different kinds of privacy leaks that can
happen on the Bitcoin blockchain. We recommend you read at least
the first few subsections under "`Blockchain attacks on privacy.`"

The takeaway is that privacy in Bitcoin isn't perfect. It requires a
significant amount of work to transact privately. Most people aren't
prepared to go that far for privacy. There seems to be a clear
trade-off between privacy and usability.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]

https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/b8f6a74a

Another important aspect of privacy is that the measures you take to protect your own privacy affect other
users as well. If you are sloppy with your own privacy, other people might
experience reduced privacy, too. Gregory Maxwell explains this very
plainly on the same Bitcoin Talk discussion
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3589252#msg3589252[that
we linked above], and concludes with an example:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Talk forum (2013)]
____
This actually works in practice, too... A nice whitehat hacker on IRC
was playing around with brainwallet cracking and hit a phrase with
~250 BTC in it.  We were able to identify the owner from just the
address alone, because they'd been paid by a Bitcoin service that
reused addresses and he was able to talk them into giving up the users
contact information. He actually got the user on the phone, they were
shocked and confused— but grateful to not be out their coin.  A happy
ending there. (This isn't the only example of it, by far ... but its
one of the more fun ones).
____

In this case, it all went well thanks to the philanthropically-minded
hacker, but don't count on that next time.

[[nonblockchainprivacy]]
=== Non-blockchain privacy

[qrcode,role=qrcode]

https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/f99c6f48

While the blockchain proves to be a notorious source of privacy leaks,
there are plenty of other leaks that don't use the blockchain, some
sneakier than others. These range from key-loggers to network traffic
analysis. To read up on some of these methods, please refer again to
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Non-blockchain_attacks_on_privacy[Chris
Belcher's piece], specifically the section "`Non-blockchain attacks on
privacy`".

Among a plethora of attacks, Belcher mentions the possibility of
someone snooping on your internet connection, for example, your ISP:

[quote, Chris Belcher, Bitcoin wiki]
____
If the adversary sees a transaction or block coming out of your node
which did not previously enter, then it can know with near-certainty
that the transaction was made by you or the block was mined by you. As
internet connections are involved, the adversary will be able to link
the IP address with the discovered bitcoin information.
____

//noqr
[[kycdbs]]
However, among the most obvious privacy leaks are exchanges. Due to
laws, usually referred to as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML
(Anti-Money Laundering), that are valid in the jurisdictions they operate in,
exchanges and related companies often have to collect personal data
about their users, building up big databases about which users own
which bitcoins. These databases are great honeypots for evil
governments and criminals who are always on the lookout for new
victims. There are actual markets for this kind of data, where hackers
sell data to the highest bidder. To make things worse, the companies
that manage these databases often have little experience with
protecting financial data, in fact many of them are young start-ups, and we know for a fact that
several leaks have already occurred. A few examples are
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/probably-the-largest-kyc-data-leak-in-history-demonstrates-the-importance-of-bitcoin-privacy[India-based
MobiQwik] and
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hubspot-security-breach-leaks-bitcoin-users-data[HubSpot]

Again, protecting data against this wide range of attacks is hard, and it is likely that you
won't be fully able to do so. You'll have to opt for the trade-off between
convenience and privacy that works best for you.

[[fungibility]]
=== Fungibility

[qrcode,role=qrcode]
----
https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/cb7871a9
----

Fungibility, in the context of currencies, means that one coin is
interchangeable for any other coin of the same currency. This funny
word was briefly touched upon in <<whyprivacyimportant>>. In the
article discussed there, Gregory Maxwell https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908[stated]

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Talk forum (2013)]
____
Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin:
if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their
fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then
we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of
stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully
check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that
fail.  Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various
authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with
bad coins. This adds friction and transactional costs and makes
Bitcoin less valuable as a money.
____

Here, he speaks about the dangers derived from a lack of fungibility. Suppose that you
have a UTXO. That UTXO's history can normally be traced back several
hops, fanning out to multitudes of previous outputs. If any of those
outputs were involved in any illegal, unwanted, or suspicious
activity, then some potential recipients of your coin might
reject it. If you think that your payees will verify your coins
against some centralized whitelist or blacklist service, you might
start checking the coins you receive too, just to be on the safe side. The result is that
bad fungibility will bolster even worse fungibility.

Adam Back and Matt Corallo
https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/fungibility-overview/[gave
a presentation about fungibility] at Scaling Bitcoin in Milan in
2016. They were thinking along the same lines:

[quote, Matt Corallo and Adam Back, Fungibility Overview (2016)]
____
You need fungibility for bitcoin to function. If you receive coins and
can’t spend them, then you start to doubt whether you can spend
them. If there are doubts about coins you receive, then people are
going to go to taint services and check whether “are these coins
blessed” and then people are going to refuse to trade. What this does
is it transitions bitcoin from a decentralized permissionless system
into a centralized permissioned system where you have an “IOU” from
the blacklist providers.
____

It seems that privacy and fungibility go hand-in-hand. Fungibility will
weaken if privacy is weak, for example as coins from unwanted
people may become blacklisted. In the same way, privacy will weaken if fungibility is
weak: if there is a blacklist, you will have to ask the blacklist providers about which coins
to accept, thereby possibly revealing your IP address, email address, and
other sensitive information. These two features are so intertwined that it's hard to
talk about either of them in isolation.

[[privacymeasures]]

Several techniques have been developed to help people protecting themselves from privacy
leaks. Among the most obvious ones is, as
noted by Nakamoto in <<blockchainprivacy>>, using unique
addresses for every transaction, but several others exist. We're not
going to teach you how to become a privacy ninja. However, Bitcoin Q+A has
a https://bitcoiner.guide/privacytips/[quick summary of
privacy-enhancing technologies], somewhat ordered by
how hard they are to implement.
When you read it, you'll notice
that Bitcoin privacy often has to do with stuff outside of Bitcoin.
For example, you shouldn't brag about your bitcoins, and you should use Tor and VPN. The
post also lists some measures directly related to Bitcoin:

Full node:: If you don't use your own full node, you will leak lots of
information about your wallet to servers on the internet. Running a
full node is a great first step.

Lightning Network:: Several protocols exist on top of Bitcoin, for
example the Lightning Network and Blockstream's Liquid sidechain.

CoinJoin:: A way for multiple people to merge their transactions into
one, making it harder to do chain analysis.

In
https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-bitcoin-privacy/[a
talk] at the Breaking Bitcoin conference, Chris Belcher gave an
interesting practical example of how privacy has been improved.

[quote,Chris Belcher in "Breaking Bitcoin Privacy", Breaking Bitcoin conference (2019)]
____
They were a bitcoin casino. Online gambling is not allowed in
the US. Any customers of Coinbase that deposited straight to Bustabit
would have their accounts shutdown because Coinbase was monitoring for
this. Bustabit did a few things. They did something called change
avoidance where you go through– and you see if you can construct a
transaction that has no change output. This saves miner fees and also
hinders analysis. Also, they imported their heavily-used reused
deposit addresses into joinmarket. At this point, coinbase.com
customers never got banned. It seems Coinbase’s surveillance service
was unable to do the analysis after this, so it is possible to break
these algorithms.

https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/0a07f8cf

He also mentioned this example, among others, on the
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy[Privacy page] on the Bitcoin wiki.

Note how better privacy can be achieved by building systems on top of
Bitcoin, as is the case with Lightning Network:

.Layers on top of Bitcoin can add privacy.
image::privacy.png[width=50%]

We noted in <<trustlessness>> that the need for trust
can only increase with layers on top, but that doesn't seem to be the
case for privacy, which can be improved or made worse arbitrarily in
layers on top. Why is that? Any layer on top of Bitcoin, as explained
in <<layeredscaling>>, must use on-chain
transactions occasionally, otherwise it wouldn't be "`on top of
Bitcoin`". Privacy-enhancing layers generally try to use the base layer
as little as possible to minimize the amount of information revealed.

The above are somewhat technical ways to improve your privacy. But
there are other ways. At the beginning of this chapter, we said that
Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system. This means that users in Bitcoin
aren't known by their real names or other personal data, but by their
public keys. A public key is a pseudonym for a user, and a user can
have multiple pseudonyms. In an ideal world, your in-person identity
is decoupled from your Bitcoin pseudonyms. Unfortunately, due to the
privacy problems described in this chapter, this decoupling usually
degrades over time.

[qrcode,role=qrcode]

https://strfsh.xyz/bdp/2fec6d14

To mitigate the risks of having your personal data revealed is to not
give it out in the first place nor to give it to centralized services,
which build big databases that can leak (see <<nonblockchainprivacy>>). An article by
Bitcoin Q+A https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/[explains KYC] and the
dangers derived from it. It also suggests some steps you can take to improve
your situation.

[quote,"Bitcoin Q+A, noKYC only, Avoid the creep", bitcoiner.guide]
____
Thankfully there are some options out there to purchase Bitcoin via no
KYC sources. These are all P2P (peer to peer) exchanges where you are
trading directly with another individual and not a centralised third
party. Unfortunately some sell other coins as well as bitcoin so we
urge you to take care.
____

//noqr
The article suggests you avoid using exchanges that require KYC/AML
and instead trade in private, or use decentralized exchanges like
https://bisq.network/[bisq].

=== Conclusion

Privacy is very important but hard to achieve. There is no privacy
silver bullet. To get decent privacy in Bitcoin, you have to take
active measures, some of which are costly and time-consuming.
