== Open Source

Bitcoin is built using open source software. In this chapter we'll see
what this means, how maintenance of the software works, how open
source software in Bitcoin allows for permissionless
development. We'll dip our toes into _selection cryptography_ that
deals with how to select and use libraries in cryptographic
systems. Bitcoin's review process is explored with followed by a
section on how Bitcoin developers get funded. The last section is
about how Bitcoin's open source culture can look really weird from the
outside, and how this perceived weirdness is really a sign of good
health.

Most Bitcoin software, and especially Bitcoin Core, is open
source. This means that the source code of the software is made
available to the general public for scrutiny, tinkering, modification,
and redistribution. The definition of open source at
https://opensource.org/osd includes, among others, the following
important points:

[quote, The Open Source Definition, Open Source Initiative website]
____
Free Redistribution:: The license shall not restrict any party from
selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate
software distribution containing programs from several different
sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such
sale.
Source Code:: The program must include source code, and must allow
distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form
of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a
well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a
reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet
without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
Derived Works:: The license must allow modifications and derived
works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as
the license of the original software.
____

Bitcoin Core adheres to this definition by being distributed under the
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/COPYING[MIT License]:

The MIT License (MIT)

Copyright (c) 2009-2022 The Bitcoin Core developers
Copyright (c) 2009-2022 Bitcoin Developers

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy

copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
----

As noted in <<donttrustverify>>, it's important that users are able
to verify that the Bitcoin software they run "`works as
advertised`". To do that, these users must have unrestricted access to
the source code of the software they verify. In this chapter we'll
talk about some other interesting aspects of open source software in
Bitcoin.

=== Software maintenance

Bitcoin Core's source code is maintained in a Git repository hosted on
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin[GitHub]. Anyone can clone that
repository, without asking for permission, and inspect, build, or make
changes to it locally. This means that there are many thousands of
copies of the repository spread out throughout the globe. These are
all copies of the same repository, so what makes this specific GitHub
Bitcoin Core repository special? Technically it's not special at all,
but socially, it has become the focal point of Bitcoin development.

Bitcoin and security expert Jameson Lopp
https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/[explains this] very
well in a blog post he calls "`Who Controls Bitcoin Core?`":

[quote, Jameson Lopp on his blog, Who Controls Bitcoin Core?]
____
Bitcoin Core is a focal point for development of the Bitcoin protocol
rather than a point of command and control. If it ceased to exist for
any reason, a new focal point would emerge — the technical
communications platform upon which it’s based (currently the GitHub
repository) is a matter of convenience rather than one of definition /
project integrity. In fact, we have already seen Bitcoin’s focal point
for development change platforms and even names!
____

He goes on to explain how Bitcoin Core's software is maintained and
secured against malicious code changes. The general takeaway from this
full article is summarized at the very end:

[quote, Jameson Lopp on his blog, Who Controls Bitcoin Core?]
____
No one controls Bitcoin.

No one controls the focal point for Bitcoin development.
____

Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo talks further about the
development process in his
https://medium.com/@elombrozo/the-bitcoin-core-merge-process-74687a09d81d[Medium
post] titled "`The Bitcoin Core Merge Process`".

[quote, Eric Lombrozo on Medium.com, The Bitcoin Core Merge Process]
____
Anyone can fork the code base repository and make arbitrary changes to
their own repository. They can build a client from their own
repository and run that instead if they want. They can also make
binary builds for other people to run.

If someone wants to merge a change they’ve made in their own
repository into Bitcoin Core, they can submit a pull request. Once
submitted, anyone can review the changes and comment on them
regardless of whether or not they have commit access to Bitcoin Core
itself.
____

It should be noted that many pull requests can take a very long time
before being merged by maintainers and that's usually because of lack
of review, which often is due to <<_review,lack of _reviewers_>>.

He also talks about the process around consensus changes, but that's a
bit beyond the scope of this chapter, see instead <<upgrading>>.

=== Permissionless development

We've established the fact that anyone can write code for Bitcoin Core
without permission, but not necessarily have it merged into the main
git repository. This includes changing color schemes of the graphical
user interface, how the peer-to-peer messages are formatted, and the
consensus rules, which are the set of rules that define a valid
blockchain.

Apart from that, and probably equally important is that users are free
to develop systems on top of Bitcoin, without asking for
permission. We've seen countless of successful software projects that
build on top of Bitcoin, among them are:

Lightning Network:: A payment network that allows for fast payment of
very small amounts. Requires very few on-chain Bitcoin
transactions. Various inter-operable implementations exist, such as
https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning[c-lightning],
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd[LND],
https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair[Eclair], and
https://github.com/lightningdevkit[Lightning Dev Kit].
CoinJoin:: Multiple parties collaborate to combine their payments into
a single transaction to make <<_blockchain_privacy,address
clustering>> harder. Various implementations exist.
Sidechains:: Lock a coin on Bitcoin's blockchain in a certain way to
unlock them on some other blockchain. This allows for Bitcoin to be
moved to some other blockchain, a sidechain, to use features available
on that sidechain. Examples include
https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements[Blockstream's Elements].
OpenTimestamps:: Allows you to https://opentimestamps.org/[timestamp a
document] on Bitcoin's blockchain in a private way. You can then use
that timestamp to prove that a document must have existed prior to
that time.

Without permissionless development, many of these projects would
<<_neutrality,not have been possible>>. As stated in <<_neutrality>>,
if developers had to ask for permission to build protocols on top of
Bitcoin, only protocols that the central developer granting committee
allows would be developed.

Common for all of the listed systems are that they themselves are
licensed as open source software, often because they want people to
contribute to the code, re-use the code, or review the code, without
asking for permission. Open source has become the gold standard of
Bitcoin software licensing.

=== Pseudonymous development

Not having to ask for permission to develop Bitcoin software brings an
interesting and important option to the table. You can write and
publish code, in Bitcoin Core or any other open source projects,
without revealing your identity.

Many developers employ this option by operating under a pseudonym
which they try to keep detached from their true identity. The reasons
for doing this can vary from developer to developer. One pseudonymous
user is ZmnSCPxj. He contributes to, among other projects, Bitcoin
Core and Core Lightning, one of several implementations of Lightning
Network. https://zmnscpxj.github.io/about.html[He writes] on his web page:

[quote,ZmnSCPxj on his GitHub page]
____
I am ZmnSCPxj, a randomly-generated Internet person. My pronouns are
he/him/his.

I understand that humans instinctively desire to know my
identity. However, I think my identity is largely immaterial, and
prefer to be judged by my work.

If you are wondering whether to donate or not, and wondering what my
cost of living or my income is, please understand that properly
speaking, you should donate to me based on the utility you find my
articles and my work on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.
____

In his case, the reason for using the pseudonym is to be judged by his
merits, not by the person or persons behind the
pseudonym. Interestingly, he
https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/many-bitcoin-developers-are-choosing-to-use-pseudonyms-for-good-reason/[told
CoinDesk] who wrote an article about pseudonymous developers, that
the pseudonym was created for a different reason.

[quote,ZmnSCPxj quote from "Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms – For Good Reason",CoinDesk]
____
My initial reason [for using a pseudonym] was simply that I was
concerned [about] making a massive mistake; thus ZmnSCPxj was
originally intended to be a disposable pseudonym that could be
abandoned in such a case. However it seems to have garnered a mostly
positive reputation, so I have retained it,
____

Using a pseudonym thus allows you to speak more freely without putting
your personal reputation at risk should you say something stupid or
make some big mistake. As it turned out, his pseudonym got very
reputable and
https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1204815615678177280[he even got a
development grant], which in itself is a testament to Bitcoin's
permissionless nature.

Arguably, the most well-known pseudonym in Bitcoin is Satoshi
Nakamoto. It's unclear what his reasons for using a pseudonym was, but
in hindsight, it was probably a good decision for multiple reasons:

* As many people speculate that Nakamoto has a lot of bitcoin, it's
imperative for his financial and personal safety to keep his identity
unknown.
* Since his identity is unknown, there is no person to prosecute,
  giving various government authorities a hard time.
* There is no authoritative person to look up to, making Bitcoin more
  meritocratic and resilient against blackmailing.

Notice how these points don't just hold for Satoshi Nakamoto, but for
anyone who works in Bitcoin or holds significant amounts of the
currency, to varying degrees.

[[selectioncryptography]]
=== Selection cryptography

Open source developers often use open source libraries developed by
other people. This is a natural, and awesome part of a healthy
ecosystem. But Bitcoin software deals with real money, and as such it
needs to be extra careful when choosing which third party libraries it
should depend on.

In a
https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-04-29-gmaxwell-bitcoin-selection-cryptography/[philosophical
talk about cryptography] (search for the part that starts with "`The
art of selection cryptography`" or watch the
https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2236[video]), Gregory Maxwell wants to
redefine the term cryptography which he believes is too narrow. He
speaks about how, fundamentally, _information wants to be free_, and
makes his definition of cryptography based on that:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, The Art Of Selection Cryptography]
____
*Cryptography* is the art and science we use to fight the fundamental
nature of information, to bend it to our political and moral will, and
to direct it to human ends against all chance and efforts to
oppose it.
____

He then introduces the term _selection cryptography_, which is the art
of selecting cryptographic tools, and explains why that is an
important part of cryptography. It revolves around how to select
cryptographic libraries, tools, and practices, or as he says "`The
cryptosystem of picking cryptosystems`".

Using concrete examples, he shows how selection cryptography can
easily go horribly wrong and also proposes a list of things to think
about to do better. A distilled version of that list is:

[start=0]
. Is the software intended for your purposes?
. Are the cryptographic considerations being taken seriously?
. The review process... is there one?
. What is the experience of the authors?
. Is the software documented?
. Is the software portable?
. Is the software tested?
. Does the software adopt best practices?

While this is not a definite guide to success, it can be very helpful
to think through these things when doing selection cryptography.

Due to the issues mentioned by Maxwell above, Bitcoin Core tries
really hard to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md[minimize
it's exposure to third party libraries]. Of course, you can't
eradicate all external dependencies, or you'd have to write everything
from font rendering to implementation of system calls yourself.

=== Review

This section is named "`Review`", rather than "`Code review`", because
Bitcoin's security relies heavily on review on multiple levels, not
just source code. Also, different ideas require review on different
levels. For example a consensus rule change would require more review
on more levels than a color scheme change, or a typo fix.

An idea usually flows through several phases of discussion and review
on its way to final adoption. Some of these phases are listed below:

. An idea is posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list
. The idea is formalized in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)
. The BIP is implemented in a pull request to Bitcoin Core
. Deployment mechanisms are discussed
. Some competing deployment mechanisms are implemented in pull
requests to Bitcoin Core
. Pull requests are merged into master branch
. Users choose whether to use the software or not

In each of these phases people with different points of view and
backgrounds review the available information, be it the source code, a
BIP, or a loosely described idea. The phases usually aren't performed
in any strict top-down manner, multiple phases can happen
simultaneously, and sometimes you go back and forth between
them. Different people may also provide feedback in different phases.

One of the most prolific code reviewers on Bitcoin Core is Jon
Atack. He wrote
https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core[a
blog post] about how to review pull requests in Bitcoin Core. He
emphasizes that a good code reviewer focuses on how to best add value.

[quote, Jon Atack on his blog, How to Review Pull Requests in Bitcoin Core]
____
As a newcomer, the goal is to try to add value, with friendliness and
humility, while learning as much as possible.

A good approach is to make it not about you, but rather "How can I
best serve?"
____

He also talks about how review is the limiting factor in Bitcoin
Core. Lots of good ideas get stuck in limbo absent of review. Also,
reviewing is a great way to learn about the software while providing
value at the same time. His rule of thumb is to review 5-15 PRs before
making any PR of his own. Again, it's more about how to best serve
than to get your own code merged. Further, he's stressing the
importance of giving review at the right level. Is this the time for
nits and typos, or does the developer need more of a conceptually
oriented review?

[quote, Jon Atack on his blog, How to Review Pull Requests in Bitcoin Core]
____
A useful first question when beginning a review can be, "What is most
needed here at this time?" Answering this question requires experience
and accumulated context, but it is a useful question in deciding how
you can add the most value in the least time.
____

The second half of the post covers some useful hands-on technical
guidance on how to actually do the reviews, and provides links to
important documentation for further reading.

Bitcoin Core developer and code reviewer Gloria Zhao has written
https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin-notes/blob/master/review-checklist.md[an
article containing questions] she might ask herself during a
review. She states what she considers a good review.

[quote, Gloria Zhao on GitHub, Common PR Review Questions]
____
I personally think a good review is one where I've asked myself a lot
of pointed questions about the PR and been satisfied with the answers
to them. +
...[snip]... +
Naturally, I start with conceptual questions, then approach-related
questions, and then implementation questions. Generally, I personally
think it's useless to leave C++ syntax-related comments on a draft PR,
and would feel rude going back to "does this make sense" after the
author has addressed 20+ of my code organization suggestions.
____

Her view, that a good review should focus on what's most needed at
this point in time, aligns well with Jon Atack's writings. She
proposes lots of questions at various levels of review, but stresses
that this list is not in any way exhaustive or that it should be used
as a straight-out recipe. The list is illustrated with real-life
examples from GitHub.

=== Funding

Lots of people work with Bitcoin open source development, for Bitcoin
Core or for other projects. Some do it on their spare time without
getting any compensation, but many developers are also getting paid to
do it.

Companies, individuals, and organizations who have an interest in
Bitcoin's continued success can donate funds to developers, either
directly or through organizations that distribute the funds to
individual developers. The website polylunar.com has
https://polylunar.com/bitcoin-grants-tracker/[compiled a list of
grants] made by a broad range of individuals, organizations, and
companies. There are also a number of Bitcoin-focused companies that
hire skilled Bitcoin developers to let them work full-time on Bitcoin.

In a talk about open source development funding, Tadge Dryja
https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/funding/[summarizes
a number of funding models]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPtWegnXhJQ&list=PLaXwSyee0z4zWO0JLgcwhnjKqNBNJhBXY&index=32[video])
used for open source projects, not only Bitcoin. On his question about
how to fund Bitcoin he answers:

[quote, Tadge Dryja, Cryptoeconomic Systems Summit '19]
____
Bitcoin seems to have sublinear development costs. When bitcoin was
$20, there was a bunch of people working on it. Then we had these
coredev.tech meetings, and as bitcoin is worth 100s of times worth
more now, there’s not even 2x as many people working on it. There’s
more people working on it, as the price has gone up, but it’s
definitely sublinear.
____

The 2x figure should be taken with a grain of salt, it's probably
more, but his point is that the amount of development work scales
sublinearly with the price of bitcoin. He's not sure whether that's a
good thing or a bad thing. On one hand we'd get even better systems
with more funding, but on the other hand we'd get almost as good a
system with less funding. The https://coredev.tech/[coredev.tech] he
mentions is an initiative by developers to meet in person to discuss
proposals, review code, and meet collabortors in person.

=== Culture shock

People sometimes get the impression that there's a lot of infighting
and endless heated debates among Bitcoin developers, and that they are
incapable of making decisions.

For example, the <<taproot-deployment,Taproot deployment mechanism>>
was discussed over a long period of time and two "`camps`" formed. One
which wanted to "`fail`" the upgrade if miners hadn't overwhelmingly
voted for the new rules after a certain timeout occurred, and one
which wanted to enforce the rules after the timeout. Michael Folkson
summarizes the arguments from the two camps in
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018380.html[an
email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list].

The discussions went on seemingly forever, and it was really hard to
see any consensus on this forming any time soon. This got people
frustrated and as a result the heat intensified. Gregory Maxwell
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hrlpnc/technical_taproot_why_activate/fyqbn8s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[worried
on Reddit] (as user nullc) that the lengthy discussions would make the
upgrade less safe.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell on Reddit, Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow?]
____
At this juncture, additional waiting isn't adding more review and
certainty. Instead, additional delay is sapping inertia and
potentially increasing risk somewhat as people start forgetting
details, delaying work on downstream usage (like wallet support), and
not investing as much additional review effort as they would be
investing if they felt confident about the activation timeframe.
____

Eventually, this dispute got resolved through a new proposal from
David Harding and Russel O'Connor called _Speedy Trial_, which would
be a comparatively short signaling period to give miners a chance to
lock in activation of Taproot, or fail fast. If they do activate
within that window, then Taproot activates approximately 6 months
later. If they don't, then the community has gained some new knowledge
about the miners' intentions, and can make a new proposal for
deployment. This upgrade is covered in more detail in <<upgrading>>.

Someone not used to Bitcoin's development process would probably think
these heated debates look awfully bad and even toxic. There are at
least two factors that make it look bad, in some people's eyes:

* Compared to closed source companies, all debates happen in the open,
  unedited. A software company like Google would never let employees
  debate proposed features in the open, and at most publish a
  statement about the company's stance on the subject. This makes
  companies look more harmonic compared to Bitcoin.
* Since Bitcoin is permissionless, it means anyone is allowed to voice
  their opinions. This is fundamentally different from a closed source
  company that have a handful of people with an opinion, usually
  like-minded. The plethora of expressed opinions in Bitcoin is simply
  staggering compared to for example PayPal.

Most Bitcoin developers would argue that this openness is a good and
healthy environment, and even necessary for producing the best
outcome.

As hinted in <<sabotage,the Adversarial thinking chapter>>, the second
bullet above comes with a downside. An attacker could use stalling
tactics, maybe from the https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184[Simple
Sabotage Field Manual], to distort the decision making and development
process.

Another thing worth mentioning is that, as noted in <<selectioncryptography>>,
since Bitcoin is money, and Bitcoin Core secures unfathomable amounts
of money, security is not taken lightly. Seasoned Bitcoin Core
developers might appear very hard-headed for this reason, and it's
usually warranted. A feature with a weak rationale is not going to be
accepted. The same would happen if it breaks the
<<donttrustverify,reproducible builds>>, adds new dependencies, or
if your code doesn't follow
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md[best
practices].

New (and old) developers can get frustrated by this. But as usual in
open source software, you can always fork the repository, merge
whatever you want into your fork, and build and run your own binary.
