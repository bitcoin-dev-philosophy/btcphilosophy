== Open Source

image::opensource-banner.jpg[]

Bitcoin is built using open source software. In this chapter we analyze
what this means, how maintenance of the software works, and how open
source software in Bitcoin allows for permissionless
development. We dip our toes into _selection cryptography_, which
deals with the selection and use of libraries in cryptographic
systems. The chapter includes a section about Bitcoin's review process, followed by another one on the ways Bitcoin developers get funded. The last section talks
about how Bitcoin's open source culture can look really weird from the
outside, and why this perceived weirdness is really a sign of good
health.

Most Bitcoin softwares, and especially Bitcoin Core, is open
source. This means that the source code of the software is made
available to the general public for scrutiny, tinkering, modification,
and redistribution. The definition of open source at
https://opensource.org/osd[] includes, among others, the following
important points:

[quote, The Open Source Definition, Open Source Initiative website]
____
Free Redistribution:: The license shall not restrict any party from
selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate
software distribution containing programs from several different
sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such
sale.
Source Code:: The program must include source code, and must allow
distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form
of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a
well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a
reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet
without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
Derived Works:: The license must allow modifications and derived
works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as
the license of the original software.
____

Bitcoin Core adheres to this definition by being distributed under the
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/COPYING[MIT License]:

----
The MIT License (MIT)

Copyright (c) 2009-2022 The Bitcoin Core developers
Copyright (c) 2009-2022 Bitcoin Developers

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy

copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
----

As noted in <<donttrustverify>>, it's important for users to be able
to verify that the Bitcoin software they run "`works as
advertised`". To do that, they must have unrestricted access to
the source code of the software they wish to verify.

In the upcoming sections we dive into
some other interesting aspects of open source software in
Bitcoin.

[[softwaremaintenance]]
=== Software maintenance

Bitcoin Core's source code is maintained in a Git repository hosted on
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin[GitHub]. Anyone can clone that very
repository without asking for any permission, and then inspect, build, or make
changes to it locally. This means that there are many thousands of
copies of the repository spread throughout the globe. These are
all copies of the same repository, so what makes this specific GitHub
Bitcoin Core repository so special? Technically it's not special at all,
but socially it has become the focal point of Bitcoin development.

Bitcoin and security expert Jameson Lopp
explains this very
well in a https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/[blog post] titled "`Who Controls Bitcoin Core?`":

[quote, Jameson Lopp, Who Controls Bitcoin Core? (2018)]
____
Bitcoin Core is a focal point for development of the Bitcoin protocol
rather than a point of command and control. If it ceased to exist for
any reason, a new focal point would emerge — the technical
communications platform upon which it’s based (currently the GitHub
repository) is a matter of convenience rather than one of definition /
project integrity. In fact, we have already seen Bitcoin’s focal point
for development change platforms and even names!
____

He goes on to explain how Bitcoin Core's software is maintained and
secured against malicious code changes. The general takeaway from this
full article is summarized at its very end:

[quote, Jameson Lopp, Who Controls Bitcoin Core? (2018)]
____
No one controls Bitcoin.

No one controls the focal point for Bitcoin development.
____

Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo talks further about the
development process in his
https://medium.com/@elombrozo/the-bitcoin-core-merge-process-74687a09d81d[Medium
post] titled "`The Bitcoin Core Merge Process`".

[quote, Eric Lombrozo on Medium.com, The Bitcoin Core Merge Process (2017)]
____
Anyone can fork the code base repository and make arbitrary changes to
their own repository. They can build a client from their own
repository and run that instead if they want. They can also make
binary builds for other people to run.

If someone wants to merge a change they’ve made in their own
repository into Bitcoin Core, they can submit a pull request. Once
submitted, anyone can review the changes and comment on them
regardless of whether or not they have commit access to Bitcoin Core
itself.
____

It should be noted that pull requests can take a very long time
before being merged to the repository by maintainers, and that's usually due to a lack
of review, see <<review>>, which is often due to a lack of _reviewers_.

Lombrozo also talks about the process that surrounds consensus changes, but that's a
bit beyond the scope of this chapter. See <<upgrading>> for more information on how the Bitcoin protocol gets upgraded.

=== Permissionless development

We've established that anyone can write code for Bitcoin Core
without asking for any permission, but not necessarily have it merged to the main
Git repository. This affects any modification, from changing color schemes of the graphical
user interface, to the way peer-to-peer messages are formatted, and even
consensus rules, i.e. the set of rules that define a valid
blockchain.

Probably equally important is that users are free
to develop systems on top of Bitcoin, without asking for any
permission. We've seen countless successful software projects that were
built on top of Bitcoin, such as:

//noqr
Lightning Network:: A payment network that allows for fast payment of
very small amounts. It requires very few on-chain Bitcoin
transactions. Various inter-operable implementations exist, such as
https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning[Core Lightning],
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd[LND],
https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair[Eclair], and
https://github.com/lightningdevkit[Lightning Dev Kit].
CoinJoin:: Multiple parties collaborate to combine their payments into
a single transaction to make address clustering
(explained in <<blockchainprivacy>>) harder. Various implementations exist.
Sidechains:: This system can lock a coin on Bitcoin's blockchain in order to
unlock it on some other blockchain. This allows for bitcoins to be
moved to some other blockchain, namely a sidechain, so as to use the features available
on that sidechain. Examples include
https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements[Blockstream's Elements].
OpenTimestamps:: It allows you to https://opentimestamps.org/[timestamp a
document] on Bitcoin's blockchain in a private way. You can then use
that timestamp to prove that a document must have existed prior to a certain time.

Without permissionless development, many of these projects would
not have been possible. As stated in <<neutrality>>,
if developers had to ask for permission to build protocols on top of
Bitcoin, only the protocols allowed by the central developer granting committee 
would be developed.

It is common for systems like the ones listed above to be themselves
licensed as open source software, which in turn allows for people to
contribute, re-use, or review their code without
asking for any permission. Open source has become the gold standard of
Bitcoin software licensing.

=== Pseudonymous development

Not having to ask for permission to develop Bitcoin software brings an
interesting and important option to the table: you can write and
publish code, in Bitcoin Core or any other open source project,
without revealing your identity.

Many developers choose this option by operating under a pseudonym
and trying to keep it detached from their true identity. The reasons
for doing this can vary from developer to developer. One pseudonymous
user is ZmnSCPxj. Among other projects, he contributes to Bitcoin
Core and Core Lightning, one of several implementations of Lightning
Network. https://zmnscpxj.github.io/about.html[He writes] on his web page:

[quote,ZmnSCPxj on his GitHub page]
____
I am ZmnSCPxj, a randomly-generated Internet person. My pronouns are
he/him/his.

I understand that humans instinctively desire to know my
identity. However, I think my identity is largely immaterial, and
prefer to be judged by my work.

If you are wondering whether to donate or not, and wondering what my
cost of living or my income is, please understand that properly
speaking, you should donate to me based on the utility you find my
articles and my work on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.
____

In his case, the reason for using a pseudonym is to be judged on his
merits and not on who the person or persons behind the
pseudonym is or are. Interestingly, he revealed in an
https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/many-bitcoin-developers-are-choosing-to-use-pseudonyms-for-good-reason/[article on
CoinDesk] that
the pseudonym was created for a different reason.

[quote, Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms – For Good Reason on CoinDesk (2021)]
____
My initial reason [for using a pseudonym] was simply that I was
concerned [about] making a massive mistake; thus ZmnSCPxj was
originally intended to be a disposable pseudonym that could be
abandoned in such a case. However it seems to have garnered a mostly
positive reputation, so I have retained it
____

Using a pseudonym indeed allows you to speak more freely without putting
your personal reputation at risk should you say something stupid or
make some big mistake. As it turned out, his pseudonym got very
reputable and in 2019
https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1204815615678177280[he even got a
development grant], which is in itself a testament to Bitcoin's
permissionless nature.

Arguably, the most well-known pseudonym in Bitcoin is Satoshi
Nakamoto. It's unclear why he chose to be pseudonymous, but
with hindsight it was probably a good decision for multiple reasons:

* As many people speculate that Nakamoto owns a lot of bitcoin, it's
imperative for his financial and personal safety to keep his identity
unknown.
* Since his identity is unknown, there is no possibility of prosecuting anyone, which
  gives various government authorities a hard time.
* There is no authoritative person to look up to, making Bitcoin more
  meritocratic and resilient against blackmailing.

Notice that these points don't just hold true for Satoshi Nakamoto, but for
anyone working in Bitcoin or holding significant amounts of the
currency, to varying degrees.

[[selectioncryptography]]
=== Selection cryptography

Open source developers often make use of open source libraries developed by
other people. This is a natural and awesome part of any healthy
ecosystem. But Bitcoin software deals with real money and, in light of this, developers need to be extra careful when choosing which third party libraries it should depend on.

In a philosophical
https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-04-29-gmaxwell-bitcoin-selection-cryptography/[talk
about cryptography] (you may find the video
https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2236[here]), Gregory Maxwell wants to
redefine the term "`cryptography`" which he believes to be too narrow. He
explains that fundamentally _information wants to be free_, and
makes his definition of cryptography based on that:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Selection Cryptography (2015)]
____
*Cryptography* is the art and science we use to fight the fundamental
nature of information, to bend it to our political and moral will, and
to direct it to human ends against all chance and efforts to
oppose it.
____

He then introduces the term _selection cryptography_, referred to as the art
of selecting cryptographic tools, and explains why it is an
important part of cryptography. It revolves around how to select
cryptographic libraries, tools, and practices, or as he says "`the
cryptosystem of picking cryptosystems`".

Using concrete examples, he shows how selection cryptography can
easily go horribly wrong, and also proposes a list of questions
you could ask yourself when practicing it.
Below is a distilled version of that list:

[start=1]
. Is the software intended for your purposes?
. Are the cryptographic considerations being taken seriously?
. The review process... is there one?
. What is the experience of the authors?
. Is the software documented?
. Is the software portable?
. Is the software tested?
. Does the software adopt best practices?

While this is not the ultimate guide to success, it can be very helpful
to go through these points when doing selection cryptography.

Due to the issues mentioned above by Maxwell, Bitcoin Core tries
really hard to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md[minimize its exposure to third party libraries]. Of course, you can't
eradicate all external dependencies, otherwise you'd have to write everything by yourself,
from font rendering to implementation of system calls.

[[review]]
=== Review

This section is named "`Review`", rather than "`Code review`", because
Bitcoin's security relies heavily on review at multiple levels, not
just source code. Moreover, different ideas require review at different
levels: a consensus rule change would require a deeper review
at more levels compared to a color scheme change or a typo fix.

On its way to final adoption, an idea usually flows through 
several phases of discussion and review. 
Some of these phases are listed below:

. An idea is posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list
. The idea is formalized into a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)
. The BIP is implemented in a pull request (PR) to Bitcoin Core
. Deployment mechanisms are discussed
. Some competing deployment mechanisms are implemented in pull
requests to Bitcoin Core
. Pull requests are merged to the master branch
. Users choose whether to use the software or not

At each of these phases people with different points of view and
backgrounds review the available information, be it the source code, a
BIP, or just a loosely described idea. The phases are usually not performed
in any strict top-down manner, indeed multiple phases can happen
simultaneously, and sometimes you go back and forth between
them. Different people may also provide feedback during different phases.

One of the most prolific code reviewers on Bitcoin Core is Jon
Atack. He wrote
https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core[a
blog post] about how to review pull requests in Bitcoin Core. He
emphasizes that a good code reviewer focuses on how to best add value.

[quote, Jon Atack, How to Review Pull Requests in Bitcoin Core (2020)]
____
As a newcomer, the goal is to try to add value, with friendliness and
humility, while learning as much as possible.

A good approach is to make it not about you, but rather "How can I
best serve?"
____

He highlights the fact that review is a truly limiting factor in Bitcoin
Core. Lots of good ideas get stuck in a limbo where no review occurs, pending. Notice that
reviewing is not only beneficial to Bitcoin, but also a great way to learn about the software while providing
value to it, at the same time. Atack's rule of thumb is to review 5-15 PRs before
making any PR of your own. Again, your focus should be on how to best serve the community,
not on how to get your own code merged. On top of this, he stresses the
importance of doing review at the right level: is this the time for
nits and typos, or does the developer need more of a conceptually-oriented 
review?

[quote, Jon Atack, How to Review Pull Requests in Bitcoin Core (2020)]
____
A useful first question when beginning a review can be, "What is most
needed here at this time?" Answering this question requires experience
and accumulated context, but it is a useful question in deciding how
you can add the most value in the least time.
____

The second half of the post consists of some useful hands-on technical
guidance on how to actually do the reviewing, and provides links to
important documentation for further reading.

Bitcoin Core developer and code reviewer Gloria Zhao has written
https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin-notes/blob/master/review-checklist.md[an
article] containing questions she usually asks herself during a
review. She also states what she considers to be a good review.

[quote, Gloria Zhao, Common PR Review Questions on GitHub (2022)]
____
I personally think a good review is one where I've asked myself a lot
of pointed questions about the PR and been satisfied with the answers
to them. +
...[snip]... +
Naturally, I start with conceptual questions, then approach-related
questions, and then implementation questions. Generally, I personally
think it's useless to leave C++ syntax-related comments on a draft PR,
and would feel rude going back to "does this make sense" after the
author has addressed 20+ of my code organization suggestions.
____

Her idea that a good review should focus on what's most needed at
a specific point in time aligns well with Jon Atack's advice. She
proposes a list of questions that you may ask yourself at various levels of the review process, but stresses
that this list is not in any way exhaustive nor
a straight-out recipe. The list is illustrated with real-life
examples from GitHub.

=== Funding

Lots of people work with Bitcoin open source development, either for Bitcoin
Core or for other projects. Many do it in their spare time without
getting any compensation, but some developers are also getting paid to
do it.

Companies, individuals, and organizations who have an interest in
Bitcoin's continued success can donate funds to developers, either
directly or through organizations that in turn distribute the funds to
individual developers. The website polylunar.com has compiled a
https://polylunar.com/bitcoin-grants-tracker/[list of
grants] given out by a broad range of individuals, organizations, and
companies. There are also a number of Bitcoin-focused companies that
hire skilled developers to let them work full-time on Bitcoin.

=== Culture shock

People sometimes get the impression that there's a lot of infighting
and endless heated debates among Bitcoin developers, and that they are
incapable of making decisions.

For example, the Taproot deployment mechanism, described in <<taproot-deployment>>,
was discussed over a long period of time during which two "`camps`" formed. One
wanted to "`fail`" the upgrade if miners hadn't overwhelmingly
voted for the new rules after a certain moment, while the other
wanted to enforce the rules after that moment no matter what. Michael Folkson
summarizes the arguments from the two camps in an
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018380.html[email]
to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.

The debate went on seemingly forever, and it was really hard to
see any consensus on this forming any time soon. This got people
frustrated and as a result the heat intensified. Gregory Maxwell (as user nullc) worried
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hrlpnc/technical_taproot_why_activate/fyqbn8s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[on
Reddit] that the lengthy discussions would make the
upgrade less safe.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell on Reddit, Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow?]
____
At this juncture, additional waiting isn't adding more review and
certainty. Instead, additional delay is sapping inertia and
potentially increasing risk somewhat as people start forgetting
details, delaying work on downstream usage (like wallet support), and
not investing as much additional review effort as they would be
investing if they felt confident about the activation timeframe.
____

Eventually, this dispute got resolved thanks to a new proposal by
David Harding and Russel O'Connor called Speedy Trial, which entailed a comparatively shorter signaling period for miners to
lock in activation of Taproot, or fail fast. If they activated it
during that window of time, then Taproot would be deployed approximately 6 months
later. This upgrade is covered in more detail in <<upgrading>>.

Someone who's not used to Bitcoin's development process would probably think that
these heated debates look awfully bad and even toxic. There are at
least two factors that make them look bad, in some people's eyes:

* Compared to closed source companies, all debates happen in the open,
  unedited. A software company like Google would never let its employees
  debate proposed features in the open, indeed it would at most publish a
  statement about the company's stance on the subject. This makes
  companies look more harmonic compared to Bitcoin.
* Since Bitcoin is permissionless, anyone is allowed to voice
  their opinions. This is fundamentally different from a closed source
  company that has a handful of people with an opinion, usually
  like-minded people. The plethora of opinions expressed within Bitcoin is simply
  staggering compared to, for example, PayPal.

Most Bitcoin developers would argue that this openness brings about a good and
healthy environment, and even that it is necessary for producing the best
outcome.

As hinted in <<threats>>, the second
bullet above can be very beneficial but comes with a downside. An attacker could use stalling
tactics, like the ones outlined in the https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184[Simple
Sabotage Field Manual], to distort the decision making and development
process.

Another thing worth mentioning is that, as noted in <<selectioncryptography>>,
since Bitcoin is money and Bitcoin Core secures unfathomable amounts
of money, security in this context is not taken lightly. This is why seasoned Bitcoin Core
developers might appear very hard-headed, which attitude is
usually warranted. Indeed, a feature with a weak rationale behind it is not going to be
accepted. The same would happen if it broke the
reproducible builds (described in <<donttrustverify>>), added new dependencies, or
if the code didn't follow Bitcoin's
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md[best
practices].

New (and old) developers can get frustrated by this. But, as is customary in
open source software, you can always fork the repository, merge
whatever you want to your own fork, and build and run your own binary.
