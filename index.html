<p><em>Bitcoin Development Philosophy</em> is a guide for new Bitcoin developers
who already understand the basics of concepts and processes such as Proof-of-Work, block
building, and the transaction life cycle, and who want to level up by
gaining a deeper understanding of Bitcoin&#8217;s design trade-offs and
philosophy. It should help new developers absorb the most important
lessons of over a decade of Bitcoin development and discussion, and provide
a context for evaluating new ideas (good ones and bad ones!).</p>

<p>This chapter analyzes what decentralization is and why it&#8217;s
essential for Bitcoin to function. We distinguish between the
decentralization of miners and that of full nodes, and discuss what
they bring to the table for censorship resistance, one of Bitcoin&#8217;s
most central properties. The discussion then shifts
to understanding neutrality - or permissionlessness towards users,
miners, and developers - which is a necessary property of any
decentralized system. Lastly, we touch upon how hard it can be to
grasp a decentralized system like Bitcoin, and present some mental
models that might help you grok it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A system without any central point of control is referred to as being
<em>decentralized</em>. Bitcoin is designed to avoid having a central point
of control, or more precisely a <em>central point of censorship</em>.
Decentralization is a means to achieve <em>censorship resistance</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two major aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin: miner
decentralization and full node decentralization. Miner
decentralization refers to the fact that transaction processing isn&#8217;t performed nor
coordinated by any central entity. Full node decentralization refers to the fact that
validation of the blocks, i.e. the data that miners output, gets done at
the edge of the network, ultimately by its users, and not by a few
trusted authorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minerdecentralization"><a class="anchor" href="#minerdecentralization"></a>1.1. Miner decentralization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There had been attempts at creating digital currencies before Bitcoin,
but most of them failed due to a lack of governance decentralization
and censorship resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Miner decentralization in Bitcoin means that the <em>ordering of
transactions</em> isn&#8217;t carried out by any single entity or fixed set of
entities. It&#8217;s carried out collectively by all the actors who want
to participate in it; this miners&#8217; collective is a dynamic set of users. Anyone can
join or leave as they wish. This property makes Bitcoin censorship-resistant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Bitcoin were centralized, it would be vulnerable to those who
wished to censor it, such as governments. It would meet the same fate
as earlier attempts to create digital money. In the introduction of
<a href="https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">a paper</a> titled &#8220;Enabling
Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains&#8221;, the authors explain
how early versions of digital money weren&#8217;t equipped for an
adversarial environment (see also <a href="#adversarialthinking">Chapter 6</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David Chaum introduced digital cash as a research topic in 1983, in a
setting with a central server that is trusted to prevent
double-spending[Cha83]. To mitigate the privacy risk to individuals
from this central trusted party, and to enforce fungibility, Chaum
introduced the blind signature, which he used to provide a
cryptographic means to prevent linking of the central server’s
signatures (which represent coins), while still allowing the central
server to perform double-spend prevention. The requirement for a
central server became the Achilles’ heel of digital cash[Gri99]. While
it is possible to distribute this single point of failure by replacing
the central server’s signature with a threshold signature of several
signers, it is important for auditability that the signers be distinct
and identifiable. This still leaves the system vulnerable to failure,
since each signer can fail, or be made to fail, one by one.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It became clear that using a central server to order transactions was
not a viable option due to the high risk of censorship. Even if one
replaced the central server with a federation of a fixed set of
n servers, of which at least m must
approve of an ordering, there would still be difficulties. The problem would indeed
shift to one where users must agree on this set of n servers
as well as on how to replace malicious servers with good ones without relying on a central authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s contemplate what could happen if Bitcoin were censorable. The
censor could pressure users to identify themselves, to
declare where their money is coming from or what they&#8217;re buying with it
before allowing their transactions to enter the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the lack of censorship resistance would allow the censor to
coerce users into adopting new system rules. For example, they could
impose a change that allowed them to inflate the money supply, thereby enriching
themselves. In such an event, a user verifying blocks would have three
options to handle the new rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adopt: Accept the changes and adopt them into their full node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reject: Refuse to adopt the changes; this leaves the user with a system that doesn&#8217;t process
transactions anymore, as the censor&#8217;s blocks are now deemed invalid
by the user&#8217;s full node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move: Appoint a new central point of control; all of the users must figure out how
to coordinate and then agree on the new central control point.
If they succeed, the same issues will most likely resurface at some point in the future, considering that the system
remained just as censorable as it was before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of these options are beneficial to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Censorship resistance through decentralization is what separates Bitcoin from
other money systems, but it is not an easy thing to accomplish due to
the <em>double-spending problem</em>. This is the problem of making sure no
one can spend the same coin twice, an issue that many people thought was
impossible to solve in a decentralized fashion. Satoshi Nakamoto
write in his <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> about how
to solve the double-spending problem:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem
using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate
computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here he uses the peculiar-sounding phrase &#8220;peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
server&#8221;. The keyword here is <em>distributed</em>, which in this
context means that there is no central point of control. Nakamoto then
goes on to explain how proof-of-work is the solution. Still, no one
explains it better than
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/">Gregory
Maxwell on Reddit</a>, where he responds to someone who proposes to limit
miners&#8217; hash power to avoid potential 51% attacks:</p>
</div>
<div id="one-cpu-one-vote" class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A decentralized system like Bitcoin uses a public election. But you
can&#8217;t just have a vote of 'people' in a decentralized system because
that would require a centralized party to authorize people to
vote. Instead, Bitcoin uses a vote of computing power because it&#8217;s
possible to verify computing power without the help of any centralized
third party.</p>

<p>The post explains how the decentralized Bitcoin network can come to an
agreement on transaction ordering through the use of proof-of-work.
He then concludes by saying that the 51% attack is not particularly
worrisome, compared to people not caring about or not
understanding Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralization properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won&#8217;t

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conclusion is an important one. If people don&#8217;t protect Bitcoin&#8217;s
decentralization, which is a proxy for its censorship resistance, Bitcoin
might fall victim to centralizing powers, until it&#8217;s so centralized
that censorship becomes a thing. Then most, if not all, of its value
proposition is gone. This brings us to the next section on full node
decentralization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="fullnodedecentralization"><a class="anchor" href="#fullnodedecentralization"></a>1.2. Full node decentralization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the paragraphs above, we&#8217;ve mostly talked about miner decentralization and how
centralizating miners can allow for censorship. But there&#8217;s also another
aspect of decentralization, namely <em>full node decentralization</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The importance of full node decentralization is related to
trustlessness (see <a href="#trustlessness">Chapter 2</a>). Suppose a user stops running their own
full node due to, for example, a prohibitive increase in the cost of
operation. In that case, they have to interact with the Bitcoin network in some
other way, possibly by using web wallets or lightweight wallets, which requires a certain level of trust in the providers of these services.
The user goes from directly enforcing the network consensus rules to trusting that
someone else will. Now suppose that most users delegate consensus enforcement to a
trusted entity. In that case, the network can quickly spiral into centralization, and the
network rules can be changed by conspiring malicious actors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In
<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralist-perspective-bitcoin-might-need-small-blocks-1442090446">a
Bitcoin Magazine article</a>, Aaron van Wirdum interviews Bitcoin
developers about their views on decentralization and the risks
involved in increasing Bitcoin&#8217;s maximum block size. This discussion
was a hot topic during the 2014-2017 era, when many people argued over
increasing the block size limit to allow for more transaction
throughput.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A powerful argument against increasing the block size is that it
increases the cost of verification (see <a href="#verticalscaling">the
Scaling chapter</a>). If verification cost rises, it will push some
users to stop running their full nodes. This, in turn, will lead to
more people not being able to use the system in a
trustless way. Pieter Wuille is quoted in the article, where he
explains the risks of full node centralization.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be
convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the
decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules
their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance
because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or
mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities
can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything
that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using trustless consensus algorithms like PoW does add something no
other construction gives you (permissionless participation, meaning
there is no set group of participants that can censor your changes),
but comes at a high cost, and its economic assumptions make it pretty
much only useful for systems that define their own
cryptocurrency. There is probably only place in the world for one or a

<p>This chapter dissects the concept of trustlessness, what it means from a computer

value proposition. We then talk about what it means to use Bitcoin in
a trustless way, and what kind of guarantees a full node can and cannot

<p>People often say things like &#8220;Bitcoin is great because it&#8217;s
trustless&#8221;. What do they mean by trustless? Pieter Wuille explains
this widely used term on
<a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/45674/69518">Stack Exchange</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust we&#8217;re talking about in "trustless" is an abstract technical
term. A distributed system is called trustless when it does not
require any trusted parties to function correctly.</p>

&#8212; Pieter Wuille<br>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, the word <em>trustless</em> refers to a property of the Bitcoin
protocol whereby it can logically function without &#8220;any trusted
parties&#8221;. This is different from the trust you inevitably have to
put into the software or hardware you run. More on this latter aspect of trust will be discussed further
in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In centralized systems, we rely on a central actor&#8217;s reputation in order to make sure
that they will take care of security or roll back in case of issues,
as well as on the legal system to sanction any violations. These trust
requirements are problematic in pseudonymous decentralized systems - there is
no possibility of recourse so there really can&#8217;t be any trust. In the introduction to
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">the Bitcoin whitepaper</a>, Satoshi Nakamoto
describes this problem:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on
financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process
electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most
transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the
trust based model.  Completely non-reversible transactions are not
really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating
disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting
the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility
for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss
of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust
spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for
more information than they would otherwise need.  A certain percentage
of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment
uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but
no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel
without a trusted party</p>

<p>It seems that we can&#8217;t have a decentralized system based on trust, and
that&#8217;s why trustlessness is important in Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use Bitcoin in a trustless manner, you have to run a
fully-validating Bitcoin node. Only then will you be able to verify
that the blocks you receive from others are following the consensus
rules; for example, that the coin issuance schedule is kept and that no
double-spends occur on the blockchain. If you don&#8217;t run a full node,
you outsource verification of Bitcoin blocks to someone else and
trust them to tell you the truth, which means you&#8217;re not using Bitcoin
trustlessly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David Harding has authored
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation">an article on
the bitcoin.org website</a> explaining how running a full node - or
using Bitcoin trustlessly - actually helps you.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bitcoin currency only works when people accept bitcoins in
exchange for other valuable things. That means it’s the people
accepting bitcoins who give it value and who get to decide how Bitcoin
should work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you accept bitcoins, you have the power to enforce Bitcoin’s
rules, such as preventing confiscation of any person’s bitcoins
without access to that person’s private keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>many users outsource their enforcement power</strong>. This
leaves Bitcoin’s decentralization in a weakened state where a handful
of miners can collude with a handful of banks and free services to
change Bitcoin’s rules for all those non-verifying users who
outsourced their power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike other wallets, <strong>Bitcoin Core does enforce the rules</strong>—so if the
miners and banks change the rules for their non-verifying users, those
users will be unable to pay full validation Bitcoin Core users
like you.</p>

<p>He says that running a full node will help you verify every aspect of
the blockchain without trusting anyone else, so as to ensure that the coins you
receive from others are genuine. This is great, but there&#8217;s one important
thing that a full node can&#8217;t help you with: it can&#8217;t prevent double-
spending through chain rewrites:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that although all programs—including Bitcoin Core—are vulnerable
to chain rewrites, Bitcoin provides a defense mechanism: the more
confirmations your transactions have, the safer you are. There is no

<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter how advanced your software is, you still have to trust that
the blocks containing your coins won&#8217;t be rewritten. However, as pointed
out by Harding, you can await a number of confirmations, after which
you consider the probability of a chain rewrite small enough to be
acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The incentives for using Bitcoin in a trustless way align with the
system&#8217;s need for <a href="#fullnodedecentralization">full node
decentralization</a>. The more people who use their own full nodes, the
more full node decentralization, and thus the stronger Bitcoin stands
against malicious changes to the protocol. But unfortunately, as
explained in the full node decentralization section, users often opt
for trusted services as consequence of the inevitable trade-off between trustlessness and convenience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s trustlessness is absolutely imperative from a system
perspective. In 2018, Matt Corallo,
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/trustlessness-scalability-and-directions-in-security-models/">spoke
about trustlessness</a> at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga.
The essence of that talk is that you can&#8217;t build trustless systems on
top of a trusted system, but you can build trusted systems - for
example, a custodial wallet - on top of a trustless system.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reproducible builds are a way to design software so that many
community developers can each build the software and ensure that the
final installer built is identical to what other developers
produce. With a very public, reproducible project like bitcoin, no
single developer needs to be completely trusted. Many developers can
all perform the build and attest that they produced the same file as
the one the original builder digitally signed.</p>

<p>The article defines 5 levels of trust: trusting the site, the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To further deepen the topic of reproducible builds, Carl Dong
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/">made
a presentation about Guix</a>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2iShmUTEl8">video</a>) explaining why
trusting the operating system, libraries, and compilers can be
problematic, and how to fix that with a system called Guix, which is
used by Bitcoin Core today.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what can we do about the fact that our toolchain can have a bunch
of trusted binaries that can be reproducibly malicious? We need to be
more than reproducible. We need to be bootstrappable. We cannot have
that many binary tools that we need to download and trust from
external servers controlled by other organizations. We should know how
these tools are built and exactly how we can go through the process of
building them again, preferably from a much smaller set of trusted
binaries. We need to minimize our trusted set of binaries as much as
possible, and have an easily auditable path from those toolchains to
what we use how to build bitcoin. This allows us to maximize
verification and minimize trust.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then explains how Guix allows us to only trust a minimal binary of
357 bytes that can be verified and fully understood if you know how
to interpret the instructions. This is quite remarkable: one verifies that
the 357-byte binary does what it should, then uses it to build the
full build system from source code, and ends up with a Bitcoin Core
binary that should be an exact copy of anyone else&#8217;s build.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s up to the users to decide to what degree they want to verify the
software they use and the blockchain data they receive. As with so
many other things in Bitcoin, there&#8217;s a trade-off between convenience
and trustlessness. It&#8217;s almost always more convenient to use a
custodial wallet compared to running Bitcoin Core on your own
hardware. However, as Bitcoin software is maturing and user interfaces are
improving, over time it should get better at supporting users willing to work
towards trustlessness. Also, as users gain more knowledge over time,
they should be able to gradually remove trust from the equation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some users think adversarially (see <a href="#adversarialthinking">Chapter 6</a>) and verify
most aspects of the software they run. As a consequence, they reduce the need for trust to the bare minimum,
as they only need to trust their computer hardware and operating system. In
doing so, they also help people who don&#8217;t verify their hardware as thoroughly by
raising their voices in public to warn about any issues they might find. One
good example of this is an
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/">event that occurred in

the Bitcoin Talk forum</a>, Gregory
Maxwell walks us through a lot of good reasons why he
thinks privacy matters. Among them are free market, safety, and human
dignity:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial privacy is an essential criteria for the efficient operation
of a free market: if you run a business, you cannot effectively set
prices if your suppliers and customers can see all your transactions
against your will. You cannot compete effectively if your competition
is tracking your sales.  Individually your informational leverage is
lost in your private dealings if you don&#8217;t have privacy over your
accounts: if you pay your landlord in Bitcoin without enough privacy
in place, your landlord will see when you&#8217;ve received a pay raise and
can hit you up for more rent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial privacy is essential for personal safety: if thieves can see
your spending, income, and holdings, they can use that information to
target and exploit you. Without privacy malicious parties have more
ability to steal your identity, snatch your large purchases off your
doorstep, or impersonate businesses you transact with towards
you&#8230;&#8203; they can tell exactly how much to try to scam you for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial privacy is essential for human dignity: no one wants the
snotty barista at the coffee shop or their nosy neighbors commenting
on their income or spending habits. No one wants their baby-crazy
in-laws asking why they&#8217;re buying contraception (or sex toys). Your
employer has no business knowing what church you donate to. Only in a
perfectly enlightened discrimination free world where no one has undue
authority over anyone else could we retain our dignity and make our
lawful transactions freely without self-censorship if we don&#8217;t have
privacy.</p>

<p>We have also said that the pseudonyms are public keys, but it&#8217;s
actually addresses derived from public keys. Why do we use addresses
as pseudonyms and not something else, for example some descriptive
names, like &#8220;watchme1984&#8221;? This has been
<a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/25175/69518">explained well</a> by

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order for Bitcoin&#8217;s idea to work, you must have coins that can only
be spent by the owner of a given private key. This means that whatever
you send to must be tied, in some way, to a public key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using arbitrary pseudonyms (e.g. user names) would mean that you&#8217;d
have to then somehow link the pseudonym to a public key in order to
enable public/private key crypto. This would remove the ability to
securely create addresses/pseudonyms offline (e.g. before someone
could send money to the user name "tdumidu", you&#8217;d have to announce in
the blockchain that "tdumidu" is owned by public key "a1c&#8230;&#8203;", and
include a fee so others have a reason to announce it), reduce
anonymity (by encouraging you to reuse pseudonyms), and needlessly
bloat the size of the blockchain. It would also create a false sense
of security that you&#8217;re sending to who you think you are (if I take
the name "Linus Torvalds" before he does, then it&#8217;s mine and people
might send money thinking they&#8217;re paying the creator of Linux, not
me).</p>

<p>Blockchain privacy refers to the information you disclose by

the ones you send as well as the ones you receive.</p>

<p>As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each

<p>Chris Belcher
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy">wrote in
great detail</a> about the different kinds of privacy leaks that can
happen on the Bitcoin blockchain. We recommend you read at least
the first few subsections under &#8220;Blockchain attacks on privacy.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The takeaway is that privacy in Bitcoin isn&#8217;t perfect. It requires a
significant amount of work to transact privately. Most people aren&#8217;t
prepared to go that far for privacy. There seems to be a clear
trade-off between privacy and usability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important aspect of privacy is that the measures you take to protect your own privacy affect other
users as well. If you are sloppy with your own privacy, other people might
experience reduced privacy, too. Gregory Maxwell explains this very
plainly on the same Bitcoin Talk discussion
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3589252#msg3589252">that
we linked above</a>, and concludes with an example:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This actually works in practice, too&#8230;&#8203; A nice whitehat hacker on IRC
was playing around with brainwallet cracking and hit a phrase with
~250 BTC in it.  We were able to identify the owner from just the
address alone, because they&#8217;d been paid by a Bitcoin service that
reused addresses and he was able to talk them into giving up the users
contact information. He actually got the user on the phone, they were
shocked and confused— but grateful to not be out their coin.  A happy
ending there. (This isn&#8217;t the only example of it, by far &#8230;&#8203; but its
one of the more fun ones).</p>

<h3 id="nonblockchainprivacy"><a class="anchor" href="#nonblockchainprivacy"></a>3.5. Non-blockchain privacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the blockchain proves to be a notorious source of privacy leaks,
there are plenty of other leaks that don&#8217;t use the blockchain, some
sneakier than others. These range from key-loggers to network traffic
analysis. To read up on some of these methods, please refer again to
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Non-blockchain_attacks_on_privacy">Chris
Belcher&#8217;s piece</a>, specifically the section &#8220;Non-blockchain attacks on
privacy&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among a plethora of attacks, Belcher mentions the possibility of
someone snooping on your internet connection, for example, your ISP:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the adversary sees a transaction or block coming out of your node
which did not previously enter, then it can know with near-certainty
that the transaction was made by you or the block was mined by you. As
internet connections are involved, the adversary will be able to link
the IP address with the discovered bitcoin information.</p>
</div>

<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Chris Belcher<br>
<cite>Bitcoin wiki</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div id="kycdbs" class="paragraph">
<p>However, among the most obvious privacy leaks are exchanges. Due to
laws, usually referred to as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML
(Anti-Money Laundering), that are valid in the jurisdictions they operate in,
exchanges and related companies often have to collect personal data
about their users, building up big databases about which users own
which bitcoins. These databases are great honeypots for evil
governments and criminals who are always on the lookout for new
victims. There are actual markets for this kind of data, where hackers
sell data to the highest bidder. To make things worse, the companies
that manage these databases often have little experience with
protecting financial data, in fact many of them are young start-ups, and we know for a fact that
several leaks have already occurred. A few examples are
<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/probably-the-largest-kyc-data-leak-in-history-demonstrates-the-importance-of-bitcoin-privacy">India-based

<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hubspot-security-breach-leaks-bitcoin-users-data">HubSpot</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, protecting data against this wide range of attacks is hard, and it is likely that you
won&#8217;t be fully able to do so. You&#8217;ll have to opt for the trade-off between
convenience and privacy that works best for you.</p>

<h3 id="fungibility"><a class="anchor" href="#fungibility"></a>3.6. Fungibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fungibility, in the context of currencies, means that one coin is
interchangeable for any other coin of the same currency. This funny
word was briefly touched upon in <a href="#whyprivacyimportant">Section 3.2</a>. In the
article discussed there, Gregory Maxwell <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908">stated</a></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin:
if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their
fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then
we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of
stolen coins they won&#8217;t accept coins derived from, you must carefully
check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that
fail.  Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various
authorities because in that world we&#8217;d all not like to get stuck with
bad coins. This adds friction and transactional costs and makes
Bitcoin less valuable as a money.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, he speaks about the dangers derived from a lack of fungibility. Suppose that you
have a UTXO. That UTXO&#8217;s history can normally be traced back several
hops, fanning out to multitudes of previous outputs. If any of those
outputs were involved in any illegal, unwanted, or suspicious
activity, then some potential recipients of your coin might
reject it. If you think that your payees will verify your coins
against some centralized whitelist or blacklist service, you might
start checking the coins you receive too, just to be on the safe side. The result is that
bad fungibility will bolster even worse fungibility.</p>

<p>Adam Back and Matt Corallo
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/fungibility-overview/">gave

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need fungibility for bitcoin to function. If you receive coins and
can’t spend them, then you start to doubt whether you can spend
them. If there are doubts about coins you receive, then people are
going to go to taint services and check whether “are these coins
blessed” and then people are going to refuse to trade. What this does
is it transitions bitcoin from a decentralized permissionless system
into a centralized permissioned system where you have an “IOU” from
the blacklist providers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems that privacy and fungibility go hand-in-hand. Fungibility will
weaken if privacy is weak, for example as coins from unwanted
people may become blacklisted. In the same way, privacy will weaken if fungibility is
weak: if there is a blacklist, you will have to ask the blacklist providers about which coins
to accept, thereby possibly revealing your IP address, email address, and
other sensitive information. These two features are so intertwined that it&#8217;s hard to
talk about either of them in isolation.</p>

<h3 id="privacymeasures"><a class="anchor" href="#privacymeasures"></a>3.7. Privacy measures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several techniques have been developed to help people protecting themselves from privacy
leaks. Among the most obvious ones is, as
noted by Nakamoto&gt;&gt; in <a href="#blockchainprivacy">Section 3.4</a>, using unique
addresses for every transaction, but several others exist. We&#8217;re not
going to teach you how to become a privacy ninja. However, Bitcoin Q+A has
a quick summary of privacy-enhancing technologies, somewhat ordered by
how hard they are to implement, at
<a href="https://bitcoiner.guide/privacytips/" class="bare">https://bitcoiner.guide/privacytips/</a>. When you read it, you&#8217;ll notice
that Bitcoin privacy often has to do with stuff outside of Bitcoin.
For example, you shouldn&#8217;t brag about your bitcoins, and you should use Tor and VPN. The
post also lists some measures directly related to Bitcoin:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Full node</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use your own full node, you will leak lots of
information about your wallet to servers on the internet. Running a
full node is a great first step.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Lightning Network</dt>
<dd>
<p>Several protocols exist on top of Bitcoin, for
example the Lightning Network and Blockstream&#8217;s Liquid sidechain.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">CoinJoin</dt>

<p>A way for multiple people to merge their transactions into
one, making it harder to do chain analysis.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-bitcoin-privacy/">a
talk</a> at the Breaking Bitcoin conference, Chris Belcher gave an
interesting practical example of how privacy has been improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They were a bitcoin casino. Online gambling is not allowed in
the US. Any customers of Coinbase that deposited straight to Bustabit
would have their accounts shutdown because Coinbase was monitoring for
this. Bustabit did a few things. They did something called change
avoidance where you go through– and you see if you can construct a
transaction that has no change output. This saves miner fees and also
hinders analysis. Also, they imported their heavily-used reused
deposit addresses into joinmarket. At this point, coinbase.com
customers never got banned. It seems Coinbase’s surveillance service
was unable to do the analysis after this, so it is possible to break
these algorithms.</p>

<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy">Privacy page</a> on the Bitcoin wiki.</p>

<p>Note how better privacy can be achieved by building systems on top of
Bitcoin, as is the case with Lightning Network:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 4. Layers on top of Bitcoin can add privacy.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We noted in <a href="#trustlessness">Chapter 2</a> that the need for trust
can only increase with layers on top, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the
case for privacy, which can be improved or made worse arbitrarily in
layers on top. Why is that? Any layer on top of Bitcoin, as explained
in <a href="#layeredscaling">Section 8.2.4</a>, must use on-chain
transactions occasionally, otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;on top of
Bitcoin&#8221;. Privacy-enhancing layers generally try to use the base layer
as little as possible to minimize the amount of information revealed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above are somewhat technical ways to improve your privacy. But
there are other ways. At the beginning of this chapter, we said that
Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system. This means that users in Bitcoin
aren&#8217;t known by their real names or other personal data, but by their
public keys. A public key is a pseudonym for a user, and a user can
have multiple pseudonyms. In an ideal world, your in-person identity
is decoupled from your Bitcoin pseudonyms. Unfortunately, due to the
privacy problems described in this chapter, this decoupling usually
degrades over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To mitigate the risks of having your personal data revealed is to not
give it out in the first place nor to give it to centralized services,
which build big databases that can leak (see <a href="#nonblockchainprivacy">Section 3.5</a>). An article by
Bitcoin Q+A <a href="https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/">explains KYC</a> and the
dangers derived from it. It also suggests some steps you can take to improve
your situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thankfully there are some options out there to purchase Bitcoin via no
KYC sources. These are all P2P (peer to peer) exchanges where you are
trading directly with another individual and not a centralised third
party. Unfortunately some sell other coins as well as bitcoin so we
urge you to take care.</p>

thing is that it doesn&#8217;t really matter, or better yet it does matter in a

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A block reward is composed of the block subsidy plus transaction
fees. The block reward needs to cover Bitcoin&#8217;s security costs. We can
say for sure that under today&#8217;s conditions with regard to block subsidy, transaction fees,
bitcoin price, mempool size, hash power, degree of decentralization
etc., the incentives for every player to play by the rules are high enough to preserve a
secure monetary system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happens when the block subsidy approaches zero? To keep things simple, let&#8217;s
assume it actually equals zero. At this point, the system&#8217;s security cost
is covered through transaction fees only. What the future holds
for us when this happens, we cannot know. The uncertainty factors are
numerous and we are left to speculations. For example, Paul Sztorc&#8217;s
contribution to the subject
<a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/">in his Truthcoin

<p>When transaction fees are the main motivation for mining, the
incentives shift. Most notably, if the mempool of a miner doesn&#8217;t
contain enough transaction fees, it might become more profitable for
that miner to rewrite Bitcoin&#8217;s history rather than
extending it. Bitcoin Optech has a specific
<a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/fee-sniping/">section on this
behavior</a>, called <em>fee sniping</em>, written by David Harding:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fee sniping is a problem that may occur as Bitcoin’s subsidy continues
to diminish and transaction fees begin to dominate Bitcoin’s block
rewards. If transaction fees are all that matter, then a miner with
<code>x</code> percent of the hash rate has a <code>x</code> percent chance of mining the
next block, so the expected value to them of honestly mining is <code>x</code>
percent of the
<a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/06/02/#candidate-set-based-csb-block-template-construction">best
feerate set of transactions</a> in their mempool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, a miner could dishonestly attempt to re-mine the
previous block plus a wholly new block to extend the chain. This
behavior is referred to as fee sniping, and the dishonest miner’s
chance of succeeding at it if every other miner is honest is
<code>(x/(1-x))^2</code>. Even though fee sniping has an overall lower probability
of success than honest mining, attempting dishonest mining could be
the more profitable choice if transactions in the previous block paid
significantly higher feerates than the transactions currently in the
mempool—a small chance at a large amount can be worth more than a
large chance at a small amount.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throwing a wet blanket over our hopes for the future is the fact that if miners start
conducting fee sniping, this will incentivize others to do the same,
leaving even fewer honest miners. This could severely impair the
overall security of Bitcoin. Harding goes on to list a few
countermeasures that can be taken, such as relying on transaction
time locks to restrict where in the blockchain the transaction may
appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, given that the consensus on finite supply remains, the block
subsidy will - thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki">BIP42</a>
which fixed a very-long-term inflation bug - get to zero around year
2140. Will the transaction fees thereafter be enough to secure the
network? It&#8217;s impossible to say, but we do know a few things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A century is a <em>long</em> time from the Bitcoin perspective. If it is
still around, it will have probably evolved enormously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an overwhelming economic majority finds it necessary to change
the rules and introduce for example a perpetual annual 0.1% or 1%
monetary inflation, the supply of bitcoin will no longer be finite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With zero block subsidy and an empty or nearly empty mempool, things
can become shaky due to fee sniping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the transition to a fee-only block reward is so far in the future, it
might be wise not to jump to conclusions and try to fix the potential
issues while we can. For example, Peter Todd thinks there&#8217;s an actual risk that Bitcoin&#8217;s
security budget won&#8217;t be enough in the future, and consequently argues for a small
perpetual inflation in Bitcoin. However, he also thinks it&#8217;s not a
good idea to discuss such an issue at this time, as
<a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/peter-todd-on-the-essence-of-bitcoin">he said on the What
Bitcoin Did podcast</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, that’s a risk like 10, 20 years in the future. That is a very
long time. And, by then, who the hell knows what the risks are?</p>

<p>Perhaps we could think of Bitcoin as something organic. Imagine a
small, slowly-growing oak plant. Imagine also that you have never seen a fully
grown tree in your life. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wise then to restrain your
control issues instead of setting in advance all the rules on how this plant

<p>Upgrading Bitcoin in a safe way can be extremely difficult. Some
changes take several years to roll out. In this chapter, we learn
about the common vocabulary around upgrading Bitcoin, and explore some
examples of historic upgrades to its protocol as well as the insights that we gained
from them. Finally, we talk about chain splits and the risks and costs
related to them.</p>

<p>To get in tune for this chapter, you should read
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/dec/p1.html">David Harding&#8217;s piece on harmony
and discord</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin experts talk often of consensus, whose meaning is abstract and
hard to pin down. But the word consensus evolved from the Latin word
concentus, "a singing together,
harmony,"[<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/dec/p1.html#ftnt1">1</a>] so let us talk
not of Bitcoin consensus but of Bitcoin harmony.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Harmony is what makes Bitcoin work. Thousands of full nodes each work
independently to verify the transactions they receive are valid,
producing a harmonious agreement about the state of the Bitcoin ledger
without any node operator needing to trust anyone else. It&#8217;s similar
to a chorus where each member sings the same song at the same time to
produce something far more beautiful than any of them could produce
alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of Bitcoin harmony is a system where bitcoins are safe not
just from petty thieves (provided you keep your keys secure) but also
from endless inflation, mass or targeted confiscation, or simply the
bureaucratic morass that is the legacy financial system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter discusses how Bitcoin can be upgraded without causing
discord. Staying in harmony, i.e. maintaining consensus, is indeed one of the biggest
challenges in Bitcoin development. There are lots of nuances to
upgrade mechanisms, which might be best understood by studying actual cases of
previous upgrades. For this reason, the chapter puts much focus on historic examples, and
it starts by setting the stage with some useful vocabulary.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_vocabulary"><a class="anchor" href="#_vocabulary"></a>5.1. Vocabulary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Wikipedia,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_compatibility"><strong>forward compatibility</strong></a>
refers to the condition in which an old software can process data
created by newer softwares, ignoring the parts it doesn&#8217;t understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A standard supports forward compatibility if a product that complies
with earlier versions can "gracefully" process input designed for
later versions of the standard, ignoring new parts which it does not
understand.</p>
</div>

<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Forward compatibility<br>
<cite>Wikipedia</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vice versa,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility"><strong>backward
compatibility</strong></a> refers to when data from an old software is usable on newer
softwares. A change is said to be fully compatible if it&#8217;s both forward
and backward compatible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A change to the Bitcoin consensus rules is said to be a <strong>soft fork</strong> if
it is fully compatible. This is the most common way to upgrade
Bitcoin, for a number of reasons that we&#8217;ll discuss further in this
chapter. If a change to the Bitcoin consensus rules is backward
compatible but not forward compatible, it is called a <strong>hard fork</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a technical overview of soft forks and hard forks, please read
<a href="https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-11.html">chapter 11 of

upgrade mechanisms. It&#8217;s recommended, although not strictly
necessary, to get a grip on this before you continue reading.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the same today as it was when the genesis block was
created. Several upgrades have been made throughout the years. In 2017, Eric
Lombrozo
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/changing-consensus-rules-without-breaking-bitcoin/">spoke
at the Breaking Bitcoin conference</a>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WCaoGiAOHE&amp;t=1926s">video</a>)
about Bitcoin&#8217;s different upgrading mechanisms, pointing out how much they
have evolved over time. He even explained how Satoshi Nakamoto
once upgraded Bitcoin through a hard fork.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was actually a hard-fork in bitcoin that Satoshi did that we
would never do it this way- it’s a pretty bad way to do it. If you
look at the git commit description here
[<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/757f0769d8360ea043f469f3a35f6ec204740446">757f076</a>],
he says something about reverted makefile.unix wx-config version
0.3.6. Right. That’s all it says. It has no indication that it has a
breaking change at all. He was basically hiding it in there. He also
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=626.msg6451#msg6451">posted to
bitcointalk</a> and said, please upgrade to 0.3.6 ASAP. We fixed an
implementation bug where it is possible that bogus transactions can be
displayed as accepted. Do not accept bitcoin payments until you
upgrade to 0.3.6. If you can’t upgrade right away, then it would be
best to shutdown your bitcoin node until you do. And then on top of
that, I don’t know why he decided to do this as well, he decided to
add some optimizations in the same code. Fix a bug and add some
optimizations.</p>

<p>He points out that, be it intentionally or not, this hard fork created
opportunities for future soft forks, namely the Script operators
(opcodes) OP_NOP1-OP_NOP10. We&#8217;ll look more into <a href="#cve-2010-5141">this
code change</a> in chapter 9. These opcodes have been used for two soft

<p>Lombrozo also provides an overview of the way upgrade mechanisms have evolved
throughout the years, up until 2017. Since then, only one other major upgrade, which we analyze in <a href="#taproot-deployment">Section 5.2.3</a>, has been deployed. The long and somewhat chaotic process that led to its activation has helped us gain further insights on upgrading mechanisms in Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="segwit-upgrade"><a class="anchor" href="#segwit-upgrade"></a>5.2.1. Segwit upgrade</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While all the upgrades preceding Segwit had been more or less
painless, this one was different. When Segwit activation code was released, in October 2016, there seemed to be overwhelming
support for it among Bitcoin users, but for some reason miners
didn&#8217;t signal support for this upgrade, which stalled the activation
with no resolution in sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aaron van Wirdum describes this winding road in his Bitcoin Magazine
article
<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-long-road-to-segwit-how-bitcoins-biggest-protocol-upgrade-became-reality">The
Long Road To Segwit</a>. He starts by explaining what Segwit is and how
that taps into the block size debate. Van Wirdum then outlines the
turn of events that led to its final activation. At the center of
this process was an upgrade mechanism called <em>user activated soft
fork</em>, or UASF for short, that was proposed by user Shaolinfry.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shaolinfry proposed an alternative: a user activated soft fork
(UASF). Instead of hash power activation, a user activated soft fork
would have a “‘flag day activation’ where nodes begin enforcement at a
predetermined time in the future.” As long as such a UASF is enforced
by an economic majority, this should compel a majority of miners to
follow (or activate) the soft fork.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among other things, he cites Shaolinfry&#8217;s email to the Bitcoin-dev
mailing list. In that occasion Shaolinfry
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013643.html">argued
against miner activated soft forks</a>, listing a number of problems
with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, it requires trusting the hash power will validate after activation.
The BIP66 soft fork was a case where 95% of the hashrate was signaling
readiness but in reality about half was not actually validating the upgraded
rules and mined upon an invalid block by mistake[1].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secondly, miner signalling has a natural veto which allows a small percentage
of hashrate to veto node activation of the upgrade for everyone. To date, soft
forks have taken advantage of the relatively centralised mining landscape where
there are relatively few mining pools building valid blocks; as we move towards
more hashrate decentralization, it&#8217;s likely that we will suffer more and more
from "upgrade inertia" which will veto most upgrades.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Shaolinfry<br>
<cite>Bitcoin-dev mailing list (2017)</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shaolinfry also drew attention to a common misinterpretation of miner signaling: people generally
thought that it was a means by which miners could decide upon protocol upgrades, rather than an action that helped
coordinate upgrades. Due to this misunderstanding, miners might have also felt
obliged to proclaim in public their views on a certain soft fork, as if that
gave weight to the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UASF proposal is, in a nutshell, a &#8220;flag day&#8221; on which nodes
start enforcing specific new rules. That way, miners don&#8217;t have to
make a collective effort to coordinate the upgrade, but <em>can</em> trigger activation
earlier than the flag day if enough blocks signal support.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My suggestion is to have the best of both worlds. Since a user
activated soft fork needs a relatively long lead time before
activation, we can combine with BIP9 to give the option of a faster
hash power coordinated activation or activation by flag day, whichever
is the sooner. In both cases, we can leverage the warning systems in
BIP9. The change is relatively simple, adding an activation-time
parameter which will transition the BIP9 state to LOCKED_IN before the
end of the BIP9 deployment timeout.</p>

<p>What Corallo proposes is a combination of a miner activated soft fork

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, as something a bit more concrete, I think an activation method
which sets the right precedent and appropriately considers the above
goals, would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) a standard BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for
activation with 95% miner readiness,<br>
2) in the case that no activation occurs within a year, a six month
quieting period during which the community can analyze and discussion
the reasons for no activation and,<br>
3) in the case that it makes sense, a simple command-line/bitcoin.conf
parameter which was supported since the original deployment release
would enable users to opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month
time-horizon for flag-day activation (as well as a new Bitcoin Core
release enabling the flag universally).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This provides a very long time horizon for more standard activation,
while still ensuring the goals in #5 are met, even if, in those cases,
the time horizon needs to be significantly extended to meet the goals of
#3. Developing Bitcoin is not a race. If we have to, waiting 42 months
ensures we&#8217;re not setting a negative precedent that we&#8217;ll come to regret

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Taproot was ready for deployment in October 2020, meaning all the technical details
around its consensus rules had been implemented and had reached broad
approval within the community, discussions on how to actually deploy it
started to heat up. These discussions had been pretty low key up until
that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lots of proposals for activation mechanisms started floating around, and
David Harding
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals">summarized
them on the Bitcoin Wiki</a>. In his article he explained some properties
of BIP8, which at that time had some recent changes made in order to make it
more flexible.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the time this document is being written,
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki">BIP8</a>
has been drafted based on lessons learned in 2017. One notable change
following BIPs 9+148 is that forced activation is now based on block
height rather than median time past; a second notable change is that
forced activation is a boolean parameter chosen when a soft fork’s
activation parameters are set either for the initial deployment or
updated in a later deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BIP8 without forced activation is very similar to
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki">BIP9</a>
version bits with timeout and delay, with the only significant
difference being BIP8’s use of block heights compared to BIP9’s use of
median time past. This setting allows the attempt to fail (but it can
be retried later).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BIP8 with forced activation concludes with a mandatory signaling
period where all blocks produced in compliance with its rules must
signal readiness for the soft fork in a way that will trigger
activation in an earlier deployment of the same soft fork with
non-mandatory activation. In other words, if node version x is
released without forced activation and, later, version y is released
that successfully forces miners to begin signaling readiness within
the same time period, both versions will begin enforcing the new
consensus rules at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This flexibility of the revised BIP8 proposal makes it possible to
express some other ideas in terms of what they would look like using
BIP8. This provides a common factor to use for categorizing many
different proposals.</p>

around whether <code>lockinontimeout</code> should be <code>true</code> (as in a user

Harding) or <code>false</code> (as in a miner activated soft fork, referred to as

<p>Among the proposals listed, one of them was titled &#8220;Let’s see what

<p>During those seven months, the discussion went on and it seemed like
there was no way to reach broad consensus over which deployment

<code>lockinontimeout=false</code> (the &#8220;try and if it fails rethink&#8221; crowd). Since
there was no overwhelming support for any of these options, the
debate went in circles with seemingly no way forward. Some of
these discussions were held on IRC, in a channel called

<p>The earlier version of this proposal was documented over 200 days ago[3]

was merged (which is a bit unrealistic), we would&#8217;ve either be less than
two months away from having taproot or we would have moved on to the
next activation attempt over a month ago.</p>

<p>Instead, we&#8217;ve debated at length and don&#8217;t appear to be any closer to
what I think is a widely acceptable solution than when the mailing list

think Speedy Trial is a way to generate fast progress that will either
end the debate (for now, if activation is successful) or give us some
actual data upon which to base future taproot activation proposals.</p>

it&#8217;s not clear how the next upgrade will be deployed. Speedy Trial was

<h3 id="upgrading-risks"><a class="anchor" href="#upgrading-risks"></a>5.3. Risks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the activation of any fork, be it hard or soft, miner activated or user
activated, there&#8217;s the risk of a long-lasting chain split. A split that
lingers for more than a few blocks can cause severe damage to the
sentiment around Bitcoin as well as to its price. But above all, it
would cause great confusion over what Bitcoin is. Is Bitcoin this
chain or that chain?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The risk with a user activated soft fork is that the new rules get
activated even if the majority of the hash power doesn&#8217;t support
them. This scenario would result in a long-lasting chain split, which
would persist until the majority of the hash power adopts the new
rules. It could be especially hard to incentivize miners to switch to
the new chain if they had already mined blocks after the split on the
old chain, because by switching branch they would be abandoning their
own block rewards. However, it&#8217;s worth mentioning a remarkable episode: in March 2013
a long-lasting split, explained in <a href="#march2013split">Section 9.2.3</a>, occurred due to an
unintentional hard fork and, contrary to this incentive, two major mining pools made the decision to
abandon their branch of the split in order to restore consensus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, the risk with a miner activated soft fork is a consequence of the fact that miners can engage
in false signaling, which means that the actual share of the hash
power that supports the change could be smaller than it looks. If the actual
support doesn&#8217;t comprise a majority of the hash power, we&#8217;d probably
see a long-lasting chain split similar to the one described in the
previous paragraph. This, or at least a similar issue, has happened in
reality when BIP66 was deployed (see <a href="#bip66-splits">Section 9.2.4</a>), but it got resolved
within 6 blocks or so.</p>

<p>The classic example of a negative externality is a factory. Maybe they

negative externality, like pollution. It’s not just something that
everyone has to pay for, to clean up, or suffer from. But it’s also
2nd and 3rd order effects, like more traffic going towards the factory
as a result of more workers that need to go there. You might also
have- you might endanger some wildlife around there. It’s not that
everyone has to pay for the negative externalities, it might be
specific people, like people who were previously using that road or
animals that were near that factory, and they are also paying for the
cost of that factory.</p>

<p>In the context of Bitcoin, he exemplifies negative externalities using
Bitcoin Cash (bcash), which is a hard fork of Bitcoin created shortly
prior to that conference in 2017. He categorizes the negative externalities of

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the many examples of one-time costs, he mentions the ones incurred by exchanges.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we have a bunch of exchanges and they had a lot of one-time costs
that they had to pay. The first thing that happened is that deposits
and withdrawals had to be halted for a day or two for these exchanges
because they didn’t know what would happen. Many of these exchanges
had to dip into cold storage because their users were demanding
bcash. It’s part of their fidicuiary duty, they have to do that. You
also have to audit the new software. This is something that we had to
do at itbit. We want to spend bcash- how do we do it? We have to
download electron cash? Does it have malware? We have to go and
audit it. We had like 10 days to figure out if this was okay
or not. And then you have to decide, are we going to just allow a
one-time withdrawal, or are we going to list this new coin? For an
exchange to lis ta new coin, it’s not easy- there’s all sorts of new
procedures for cold storage, signing, deposits, withdrawals. Or you
could just have this one-off event where you give them their bcash at
some point and then you never think about it again. But that has its
problems too. And finally, and whatever way you do it, withdrawals or
listing– you are going to need new infrastructure to work with this
token in some way, even if it’s a one-time withdrawal. You need some
way to give these tokens to your users. Again, short-notice. Right? No
time to do this, has to be done quickly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter addresses <em>adversarial thinking</em>, a mindset that focuses
on what could go wrong and how adversaries might act. We start out
by discussing Bitcoin&#8217;s security assumptions and security model, after which
we explain how ordinary users can improve
their self-sovereignty and Bitcoin&#8217;s full node decentralization by thinking adversarially. Then, we
look into some actual threats to Bitcoin as well as into the adversary&#8217;s mind.
Lastly, we talk about the <em>axiom of resistance</em> which
can help you understand why people are working on Bitcoin in the
first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When discussing security within various systems, it&#8217;s important to understand
what the security assumptions are. A typical security assumption in
Bitcoin is &#8220;the discrete logarithm problem is hard to solve&#8221;, which,
simply put, means it&#8217;s practically impossible to find a private key
that corresponds to a particular public key. Another pretty strong
security assumption is that a majority of the network&#8217;s hashpower is
honest, meaning that they play by the rules. If these assumptions are
proven wrong, then Bitcoin is in trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2015 Andrew Poelstra
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/">gave
a talk</a> at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, during which he
analyzed Bitcoin&#8217;s security assumptions. He starts by noticing that many systems
disregard adversaries to some extent; for example, it&#8217;s really hard to
protect a building against all types of adversarial events. Instead, we generally
accept the possibility that someone may burn the building down, and to some extent prevent
this and other adversarial behaviors through law enforcement etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But online things are different:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, online we don’t have this. We have pseudonymous and anonymous
behavior, anyone can connect to everyone and hurt the system. If it’s
possible to adversarially hurt the system, then they will do it. We
cannot assume they will be visible and that they will be caught.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequence is that all known weaknesses in Bitcoin must somehow be taken
care of, otherwise they will be exploited. After all, Bitcoin
is the greatest honey pot in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Poelstra goes on to mention how Bitcoin is a new kind of system; it&#8217;s
more nebulous than, for example, a signing protocol which has very
clear-cut security assumptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On his personal blog, software engineer Jameson Lopp,
<a href="https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/">dives into this</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a
formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can
do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system
in order to better understand and attempt to describe it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, we have a system that seems to be working in practice, but that we can&#8217;t
formally prove to be secure. A proof is probably not possible due to
the complexity of the system itself.</p>

<p>There are a lot of known weaknesses in Bitcoin, and many of them are
actively being exploited. To get a glimpse of that, have a look at the
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses">Weaknesses page</a> on

wallet theft and denial-of-service attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker attempts to fill the network with clients that they
control, you would then be very likely to connect only to attacker
nodes. Although Bitcoin never uses a count of nodes for anything,
completely isolating a node from the honest network can be helpful in
the execution of other attacks.</p>

<p>This type of attack is called <em>Sybil attack</em>, and it occurs whenever a
single entity controls multiple nodes in a network and uses them to appear
as multiple entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the quote also mentions, the Sybil attack is not effective on the
Bitcoin network because there is no voting through nodes or other numerable entities, but rather
through computing power (see <a href="#minerdecentralization">Section 1.1</a>). Nonetheless, this flat
structure leaves the system susceptible to other attacks.
The Bitcoin wiki page also outlines other possible attacks, such as information hiding
(often referred to as <em>eclipse attack</em>), and the way Bitcoin Core implements
some heuristic countermeasures against such attacks.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 6. Excerpt from the Simple Sabotage Field Manual</div>
</div>
<div id="sabotage" class="paragraph">
<p>To better understand the adversary&#8217;s mind, it might be helpful to
get a glimpse into how they operate. A US government body named
Office of Strategic Services, which operated during World War II and had among its purposes to
conduct espionage, perform sabotage and spread propaganda,
produced a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184">manual</a>
for their personnel on how to properly sabotage the enemy. Its title was &#8220;Simple
Sabotage Field Manual&#8221; and contained concrete tips on infiltrating
the enemy to make their lives hard. The tips range from burning
down warehouses to causing wear to drills in order to decrease the enemy&#8217;s
efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, there is a section (<a href="#fig-sabotage-manual">Figure 6</a>) about how an
infiltrator can disrupt organizations. It&#8217;s not hard to see how such
tactics could be used to target the Bitcoin development process (see
<a href="#opensource">Chapter 7</a>), which is open for anyone to participate in. A
dedicated attacker can keep stalling progress by endless concerns of
irrelevant issues, haggle over precise wordings, and attempt to reiterate discussions
that have already been comprehensively addressed. The attacker can also hire
a troll army to multiply their own effectiveness; we can call this a social
Sybil attack. Using a social Sybil attack, they can make it look like there&#8217;s
more resistance against a proposed change than there actually is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This highlights how a determined state can and will do everything in
its power to destroy the enemy, including breaking it down from
the inside. Since Bitcoin is a form of money that competes with
established fiat currencies, chances are that states will regard
Bitcoin as an enemy.</p>

<p>Eric Voskuil
<a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Axiom-of-Resistance">writes

resistance&#8221;:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words there is an assumption that it is <em>possible</em> for a
system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but
deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to empirical study of
behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an
entirely different system than Bitcoin.</strong> If one assumes it is <em>not
possible</em> for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not
make sense in the context of Bitcoin - just as conclusions in
spherical geometry contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be
permissionless or censorship-resistant without the axiom? The
contradiction leads one to make obvious errors in an attempt to
rationalize the conflict.</p>

&#8212; Eric Voskuil<br>
<cite>Cryptoeconomics wiki (2017)</cite>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What he&#8217;s essentially saying is that only when one assumes it&#8217;s possible to
create a system that states can&#8217;t control, is it meaningful to try.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that to work on Bitcoin you should accept the axiom of
resistance, otherwise you&#8217;d better spend your time on other
projects. Acknowledging that axiom helps you focusing your development

before being merged to the repository by maintainers, and that&#8217;s usually due to a lack
of review, see <a href="#review">Section 7.5</a>, which is often due to a lack of <em>reviewers</em>.</p>

<h3 id="_permissionless_development"><a class="anchor" href="#_permissionless_development"></a>7.2. Permissionless development</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve established that anyone can write code for Bitcoin Core
without asking for any permission, but not necessarily have it merged to the main
Git repository. This affects any modification, from changing color schemes of the graphical
user interface, to the way peer-to-peer messages are formatted, and even
consensus rules, i.e. the set of rules that define a valid
blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably equally important is that users are free
to develop systems on top of Bitcoin, without asking for any
permission. We&#8217;ve seen countless successful software projects that were
built on top of Bitcoin, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Lightning Network</dt>
<dd>
<p>A payment network that allows for fast payment of
very small amounts. It requires very few on-chain Bitcoin
transactions. Various inter-operable implementations exist, such as
<a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning">Core Lightning</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd">LND</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair">Eclair</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit">Lightning Dev Kit</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">CoinJoin</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiple parties collaborate to combine their payments into
a single transaction to make address clustering
(explained in <a href="#blockchainprivacy">Section 3.4</a>) harder. Various implementations exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Sidechains</dt>
<dd>
<p>This system can lock a coin on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain in order to
unlock it on some other blockchain. This allows for bitcoins to be
moved to some other blockchain, namely a sidechain, so as to use the features available
on that sidechain. Examples include
<a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements">Blockstream&#8217;s Elements</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">OpenTimestamps</dt>
<dd>
<p>It allows you to <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">timestamp a
document</a> on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain in a private way. You can then use
that timestamp to prove that a document must have existed prior to a certain time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without permissionless development, many of these projects would
not have been possible. As stated in <a href="#neutrality">Section 1.3</a>,
if developers had to ask for permission to build protocols on top of
Bitcoin, only the protocols allowed by the central developer granting committee
would be developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is common for systems like the ones listed above to be themselves
licensed as open source software, which in turn allows for people to
contribute, re-use, or review their code without
asking for any permission. Open source has become the gold standard of
Bitcoin software licensing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pseudonymous_development"><a class="anchor" href="#_pseudonymous_development"></a>7.3. Pseudonymous development</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not having to ask for permission to develop Bitcoin software brings an
interesting and important option to the table: you can write and
publish code, in Bitcoin Core or any other open source project,
without revealing your identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many developers choose this option by operating under a pseudonym
and trying to keep it detached from their true identity. The reasons
for doing this can vary from developer to developer. One pseudonymous
user is ZmnSCPxj. Among other projects, he contributes to Bitcoin
Core and Core Lightning, one of several implementations of Lightning
Network. <a href="https://zmnscpxj.github.io/about.html">He writes</a> on his web page:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am ZmnSCPxj, a randomly-generated Internet person. My pronouns are
he/him/his.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that humans instinctively desire to know my
identity. However, I think my identity is largely immaterial, and
prefer to be judged by my work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are wondering whether to donate or not, and wondering what my
cost of living or my income is, please understand that properly
speaking, you should donate to me based on the utility you find my
articles and my work on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; ZmnSCPxj on his GitHub page
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his case, the reason for using a pseudonym is to be judged on his
merits and not on who the person or persons behind the
pseudonym is or are. Interestingly, he revealed in an
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/many-bitcoin-developers-are-choosing-to-use-pseudonyms-for-good-reason/">article on
CoinDesk</a> that
the pseudonym was created for a different reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My initial reason [for using a pseudonym] was simply that I was
concerned [about] making a massive mistake; thus ZmnSCPxj was
originally intended to be a disposable pseudonym that could be
abandoned in such a case. However it seems to have garnered a mostly
positive reputation, so I have retained it</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a pseudonym indeed allows you to speak more freely without putting
your personal reputation at risk should you say something stupid or
make some big mistake. As it turned out, his pseudonym got very
reputable and in 2019
<a href="https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1204815615678177280">he even got a
development grant</a>, which is in itself a testament to Bitcoin&#8217;s
permissionless nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arguably, the most well-known pseudonym in Bitcoin is Satoshi
Nakamoto. It&#8217;s unclear why he chose to be pseudonymous, but
with hindsight it was probably a good decision for multiple reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As many people speculate that Nakamoto owns a lot of bitcoin, it&#8217;s
imperative for his financial and personal safety to keep his identity
unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since his identity is unknown, there is no possibility of prosecuting anyone, which
gives various government authorities a hard time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no authoritative person to look up to, making Bitcoin more
meritocratic and resilient against blackmailing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that these points don&#8217;t just hold true for Satoshi Nakamoto, but for
anyone working in Bitcoin or holding significant amounts of the
currency, to varying degrees.</p>

<h3 id="selectioncryptography"><a class="anchor" href="#selectioncryptography"></a>7.4. Selection cryptography</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source developers often make use of open source libraries developed by
other people. This is a natural and awesome part of any healthy
ecosystem. But Bitcoin software deals with real money and, in light of this, developers need to be extra careful when choosing which third party libraries it should depend on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a philosophical
<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-04-29-gmaxwell-bitcoin-selection-cryptography/">talk
about cryptography</a> (you may find the video
<a href="https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2236">here</a>), Gregory Maxwell wants to
redefine the term &#8220;cryptography&#8221; which he believes to be too narrow. He
explains that fundamentally <em>information wants to be free</em>, and
makes his definition of cryptography based on that:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the art and science we use to fight the fundamental
nature of information, to bend it to our political and moral will, and
to direct it to human ends against all chance and efforts to
oppose it.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Gregory Maxwell<br>
<cite>Bitcoin Selection Cryptography (2015)</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then introduces the term <em>selection cryptography</em>, referred to as the art
of selecting cryptographic tools, and explains why it is an
important part of cryptography. It revolves around how to select
cryptographic libraries, tools, and practices, or as he says &#8220;the
cryptosystem of picking cryptosystems&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using concrete examples, he shows how selection cryptography can
easily go horribly wrong, and also proposes a list of questions
you could ask yourself when practicing it.
Below is a distilled version of that list:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>Is the software intended for your purposes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the cryptographic considerations being taken seriously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The review process&#8230;&#8203; is there one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the experience of the authors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the software documented?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the software portable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the software tested?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the software adopt best practices?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this is not the ultimate guide to success, it can be very helpful
to go through these points when doing selection cryptography.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the issues mentioned above by Maxwell, Bitcoin Core tries
really hard to
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md">minimize its exposure to third party libraries</a>. Of course, you can&#8217;t
eradicate all external dependencies, otherwise you&#8217;d have to write everything by yourself,
from font rendering to implementation of system calls.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="review"><a class="anchor" href="#review"></a>7.5. Review</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section is named &#8220;Review&#8221;, rather than &#8220;Code review&#8221;, because
Bitcoin&#8217;s security relies heavily on review at multiple levels, not
just source code. Moreover, different ideas require review at different
levels: a consensus rule change would require a deeper review
at more levels compared to a color scheme change or a typo fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On its way to final adoption, an idea usually flows through
several phases of discussion and review.
Some of these phases are listed below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>An idea is posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea is formalized into a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BIP is implemented in a pull request (PR) to Bitcoin Core</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment mechanisms are discussed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some competing deployment mechanisms are implemented in pull
requests to Bitcoin Core</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull requests are merged to the master branch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users choose whether to use the software or not</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At each of these phases people with different points of view and
backgrounds review the available information, be it the source code, a
BIP, or just a loosely described idea. The phases are usually not performed
in any strict top-down manner, indeed multiple phases can happen
simultaneously, and sometimes you go back and forth between
them. Different people may also provide feedback during different phases.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most prolific code reviewers on Bitcoin Core is Jon
Atack. He wrote
<a href="https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core">a
blog post</a> about how to review pull requests in Bitcoin Core. He
emphasizes that a good code reviewer focuses on how to best add value.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a newcomer, the goal is to try to add value, with friendliness and

<p>He highlights the fact that review is a truly limiting factor in Bitcoin
Core. Lots of good ideas get stuck in a limbo where no review occurs, pending. Notice that
reviewing is not only beneficial to Bitcoin, but also a great way to learn about the software while providing
value to it, at the same time. Atack&#8217;s rule of thumb is to review 5-15 PRs before
making any PR of your own. Again, your focus should be on how to best serve the community,
not on how to get your own code merged. On top of this, he stresses the
importance of doing review at the right level: is this the time for
nits and typos, or does the developer need more of a conceptually-oriented
review?</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A useful first question when beginning a review can be, "What is most

<p>Lots of people work with Bitcoin open source development, either for Bitcoin

getting any compensation, but some developers are also getting paid to
do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Companies, individuals, and organizations who have an interest in
Bitcoin&#8217;s continued success can donate funds to developers, either
directly or through organizations that in turn distribute the funds to
individual developers. The website polylunar.com has compiled a
<a href="https://polylunar.com/bitcoin-grants-tracker/">list of

<div class="paragraph">
<p>People sometimes get the impression that there&#8217;s a lot of infighting
and endless heated debates among Bitcoin developers, and that they are
incapable of making decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the Taproot deployment mechanism, described in <a href="#taproot-deployment">Section 5.2.3</a>,
was discussed over a long period of time during which two &#8220;camps&#8221; formed. One
wanted to &#8220;fail&#8221; the upgrade if miners hadn&#8217;t overwhelmingly
voted for the new rules after a certain moment, while the other
wanted to enforce the rules after that moment no matter what. Michael Folkson
summarizes the arguments from the two camps in an
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018380.html">email</a>
to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The debate went on seemingly forever, and it was really hard to
see any consensus on this forming any time soon. This got people
frustrated and as a result the heat intensified. Gregory Maxwell (as user nullc) worried
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hrlpnc/technical_taproot_why_activate/fyqbn8s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on
Reddit</a> that the lengthy discussions would make the
upgrade less safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this juncture, additional waiting isn&#8217;t adding more review and
certainty. Instead, additional delay is sapping inertia and
potentially increasing risk somewhat as people start forgetting
details, delaying work on downstream usage (like wallet support), and
not investing as much additional review effort as they would be
investing if they felt confident about the activation timeframe.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Gregory Maxwell on Reddit<br>
<cite>Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow?</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, this dispute got resolved thanks to a new proposal by
David Harding and Russel O&#8217;Connor called Speedy Trial, which entailed a comparatively shorter signaling period for miners to
lock in activation of Taproot, or fail fast. If they activated it
during that window of time, then Taproot would be deployed approximately 6 months
later. This upgrade is covered in more detail in <a href="#upgrading">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someone who&#8217;s not used to Bitcoin&#8217;s development process would probably think that
these heated debates look awfully bad and even toxic. There are at
least two factors that make them look bad, in some people&#8217;s eyes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compared to closed source companies, all debates happen in the open,
unedited. A software company like Google would never let its employees
debate proposed features in the open, indeed it would at most publish a
statement about the company&#8217;s stance on the subject. This makes
companies look more harmonic compared to Bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Bitcoin is permissionless, anyone is allowed to voice
their opinions. This is fundamentally different from a closed source
company that has a handful of people with an opinion, usually
like-minded people. The plethora of opinions expressed within Bitcoin is simply
staggering compared to, for example, PayPal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Bitcoin developers would argue that this openness brings about a good and
healthy environment, and even that it is necessary for producing the best
outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As hinted in <a href="#threats">Section 6.2</a>, the second
bullet above can be very beneficial but comes with a downside. An attacker could use stalling
tactics, like the ones outlined in the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184">Simple
Sabotage Field Manual</a>, to distort the decision making and development
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that, as noted in <a href="#selectioncryptography">Section 7.4</a>,
since Bitcoin is money and Bitcoin Core secures unfathomable amounts
of money, security in this context is not taken lightly. This is why seasoned Bitcoin Core
developers might appear very hard-headed, which attitude is
usually warranted. Indeed, a feature with a weak rationale behind it is not going to be
accepted. The same would happen if it broke the
reproducible builds (described in <a href="#donttrustverify">Section 2.1</a>), added new dependencies, or
if the code didn&#8217;t follow Bitcoin&#8217;s
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md">best
practices</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New (and old) developers can get frustrated by this. But, as is customary in
open source software, you can always fork the repository, merge
whatever you want to your own fork, and build and run your own binary.</p>

scale. We start by looking at how people have reasoned
about scaling in the past. Then, the bulk of this chapter explains various
approaches to scaling Bitcoin, specifically vertical, horizontal,
inward, and layered scaling. Each description is followed by considerations over whether the approach
interferes with Bitcoin&#8217;s value proposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Bitcoin space, different people ascribe different definitions to the word &#8220;scale&#8221;. Some conceive it as the
increase of the blockchain transaction capacity, others believe it equals to using the
blockchain more efficiently, and others see it as the development of systems on top of Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of Bitcoin, and for this book&#8217;s purposes, we define scaling as
<em>increasing Bitcoin&#8217;s usage capacity without compromising its
censorship resistance</em>. This definition encompasses several
kinds of changes, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Scaling has been a focal point of discussion since the genesis of Bitcoin. The
very first sentence of the
<a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014814.html">very
first email</a> in response to Satoshi&#8217;s announcement of the Bitcoin whitepaper on the

<p>The conversation in itself might not be very interesting nor accurate, but
it shows that scaling has been a concern from the very beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions over scaling reached their peak interest around 2015-2017, when there were many
different ideas circulating about whether and how to increase the
maximum block size limit. That was a rather uninteresting discussion
about changing a parameter in the source code, a change that didn&#8217;t
fundamentally solve anything but pushed the problem of scaling
further into the future, building technical debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2015, a conference called <a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/">Scaling
Bitcoin</a> was held in Montreal, with a follow-up conference six months
later in Hong Kong and thereafter in a number of other locations around the world. The focus was precisely on how to
address scaling. Many Bitcoin developers and other enthusiasts gathered at these conferences to
discuss various scaling issues and proposals. Most of these
discussions didn&#8217;t revolve around block size increases but on more long-term
solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the Hong Kong conference in December 2015, Gregory Maxwell
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html">summarized
his view</a> on many of the issues that had been debated, starting off with
some general scaling philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the available technology, there are fundamental trade-offs
between scale and decentralization. If the system is too costly people
will be forced to trust third parties rather than independently
enforcing the system&#8217;s rules. If the Bitcoin blockchain’s resource
usage, relative to the available technology, is too great, Bitcoin
loses its competitive advantages compared to legacy systems because
validation will be too costly (pricing out many users), forcing trust
back into the system.  If capacity is too low and our methods of
transacting too inefficient, access to the chain for dispute

<p>He speaks about the trade-off between throughput and
decentralization. If you allow for bigger blocks, you will push some
people off the network because they won&#8217;t have the resources to validate
the blocks anymore. But on the other hand, if access to block space
becomes more expensive, fewer people will be able to afford using it as a
dispute resolution mechanism. In both cases, users are pushed
towards trusted services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He continues by summarizing the many approaches to scaling presented at the
conference. Among them are more computationally efficient signature
verifications, <em>segregated witness</em> including a block size limit
change, a more space-efficient block propagation mechanism, and
building protocols on top of Bitcoin in layers. Many of these
approaches have since been implemented.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As hinted above, scaling Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be about
increasing the block size limit or other limits. We now go through some
general approaches to scaling, some of which don&#8217;t suffer from the
throughput-decentralization trade-off mentioned in the previous
section.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="verticalscaling"><a class="anchor" href="#verticalscaling"></a>8.2.1. Vertical scaling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vertical scaling is the process of increasing the computing resources
of the machines processing data. In the context of Bitcoin, these latter would be
the full nodes, namely the machines that validate the blockchain on behalf of
their users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most commonly discussed technique for vertical scaling
in Bitcoin is the increase in the
block size limit. This would require some full nodes to upgrade their
hardware to keep up with the increasing computational
demands. The downside is that it happens at the cost of
centralization, as was discussed in the previous section and more
in depth in <a href="#fullnodedecentralization">Section 1.2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the negative effects on full node decentralization, vertical
scaling might also negatively impact Bitcoin&#8217;s
mining decentralization (explained in <a href="#minerdecentralization">Section 1.1</a>) and security in
less obvious ways. Let&#8217;s have a look at how miners &#8220;should&#8221;
operate. Say a miner mines a block at height 7 and publishes that
block on the Bitcoin network. It will take some time for this block to
reach broad acceptance, which is mainly due to two factors:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transfer of the block between peers takes time due to bandwidth
limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validation of the block takes time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While block 7 is being propagated through the network, many miners are still
mining on top of block 6 because they haven&#8217;t received and validated
block 7 yet. During this time, if any of these miners finds a new
block at height 7, there will be two competing blocks at that height.
There can only be one block at height 7 (or any other height), which means one of the two candidates
must become stale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, stale blocks happen because it takes time for each block to
propagate, and the longer propagation takes, the higher the
probability of stale blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose that the block size limit is lifted and that the average block
size increases substantially. Blocks would then propagate slower across the
network due to bandwidth limitations and verification time. An increase in propagation time
will also increase the chances of stale blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Miners don&#8217;t like to have their blocks staled because they&#8217;ll lose
their block reward, so they will do whatever they can to avoid this
scenario. The measures they can take include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Postponing the validation of an incoming block, also known as
<em>validationless mining</em>, further discussed in <a href="#bip66splits">Section 9.2.4.4</a>. Miners can just check the block
header&#8217;s proof-of-work and mine on top of it, while in the meantime they download the
full block and validate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connecting to a mining pool with greater bandwidth and connectivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Validationless mining further undermines
full node decentralization,
as the miner resorts to trusting
incoming blocks, at least temporarily. It also hurts security to some degree because a
portion of the network&#8217;s computing power is potentially building on an
invalid blockchain, instead of building on the strongest and valid chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second bullet point has a negative effect on
miner decentralization, see <a href="#minerdecentralization">Section 1.1</a>, because usually
the pools with the best network connectivity and
bandwidth are also the largest, causing miners to gravitate towards a few big pools.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_horizontal_scaling"><a class="anchor" href="#_horizontal_scaling"></a>8.2.2. Horizontal scaling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Horizontal scaling refers to techniques that divide the workload
across multiple machines. While this is a prevalent scaling approach
among popular websites and databases, it&#8217;s not easily done in
Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people refer to this Bitcoin scaling approach as <em>sharding</em>. Basically, it consists in letting
each full node verify just a portion of the blockchain. Peter Todd
has put a lot of thought into the concept of sharding. He wrote a
<a href="https://petertodd.org/2015/why-scaling-bitcoin-with-sharding-is-very-hard">blog
post</a> explaining sharding in general terms, and also presenting
his own idea called <em>treechains</em>. The article is a difficult read,
but Todd makes some points that are quite digestible.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In sharded systems the “full node defense” doesn’t work, at least
directly. The whole point is that not everyone has all the data, so

<p>Then he presents various ideas on how to tackle sharding, or
horizontal scaling. Towards the end of the post he concludes:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a big problem though: holy !@#$ is the above complex compared
to Bitcoin! Even the “kiddy” version of sharding - my linearization
scheme rather than zk-SNARKS - is probably one or two orders of
magnitude more complex than using the Bitcoin protocol is right now,
yet right now a huge % of the companies in this space seem to have
thrown their hands up and used centralized API providers
instead. Actually implementing the above and getting it into the hands
of end-users won’t be easy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, decentralization isn’t cheap: using PayPal is one

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conclusion he makes is that sharding <em>might</em> be technically
possible, but it would come at the cost of tremendous complexity. Given
that many users already find Bitcoin too complex and prefer to use
centralized services instead, it&#8217;s going to be hard to convince them to use
something even more complex.</p>

<h4 id="_inward_scaling"><a class="anchor" href="#_inward_scaling"></a>8.2.3. Inward scaling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While horizontal and vertical scaling have historically worked out well
in centralized systems like databases and web servers, they don&#8217;t seem
to be suitable for a decentralized network like Bitcoin due to their
centralizing effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An approach that gets far too little appreciation is what we can call
<em>inward scaling</em>, which translates into &#8220;do more with less&#8221;. It refers
to the ongoing work constantly done by many developers to optimize the
algorithms already in place, so that we can do more within the existing
limits of the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improvements that have been achieved through inward scaling are
impressive, to say the least. To give you a general idea of the
improvements over the years, Jameson Lopp
<a href="https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-core-performance-evolution/">has run
benchmark tests</a> on blockchain synchronization, comparing many
different versions of Bitcoin Core going back to version 0.8.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The different lines represent different versions of Bitcoin Core. The
leftmost line is the latest, i.e. version 0.22, which was
released in September 2021 and took 396 minutes to fully sync. The
rightmost one is version 0.8 from November 2013, which took 3452
minutes. All of this - roughly 10x - improvement is due to inward
scaling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improvements could be categorized as either saving space (RAM, disk,
bandwidth, etc.) or saving computational power. Both categories
contribute to the improvements in the diagram above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of computational improvement can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1">libsecp256k1</a> library, which,
among other things, implements the cryptographic primitives needed to
make and verify digital signatures. Pieter Wuille is one of the
contributors to this library, and he wrote a
<a href="https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1450471673321381896">Twitter
thread</a> showcasing the performance improvements achieved through various pull
requests.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph shows the trend for two different 64-bit CPU types, namely ARM and x86.
The difference in performance is due to the more specialized instructions
available on x86 compared to the ARM architecture, which has fewer and
more generic instructions. However, the general trend is the same for both
architectures. Note that the Y-axis is logarithmic, which makes the
improvements look less impressive than they actually are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also several good examples of space-saving improvements that contributed to
performance enhancement. In a

would require only 57.5+43 vB = 100.5
vB in the standard use case. At worst and in rare cases, like when a standard signer is
not available for some reason, Taproot would use 107.5+43 vB = 150.5 vB. You don&#8217;t have
to understand all the details, but this should give you an idea
of how developers think about saving space - every little byte counts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from inward scaling in Bitcoin software, there are
some ways in which users can contribute to inward scaling, too. They can
make their transactions more intelligently to save on
transaction fees while simultaneously decreasing their footprints on
full node requirements. Two commonly used techniques toward such goal are called
transaction batching and output consolidation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea with transaction batching is to combine multiple payments
into one single transaction, instead of making one transaction per
payment. This can save you a lot of fees, and at the same time reduce
the block space load.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/tx-batching.png" alt="tx batching" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 10. Transaction batching combines multiple payments into a single transaction to save on fees.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Output consolidation refers to taking advantage of periods of low demand for
block space to combine multiple outputs into a single output. This
can reduce your fee cost later, when you&#8217;ll need to make a payment while the
demand for block space is high.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/utxo-consolidation.png" alt="utxo consolidation" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 11. Output consolidation. Melt your coins into one big coin when fees are low to save fees later.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may not be obvious how output consolidation contributes to inward
scaling. After all, the total amount of blockchain data is even slightly
increased with this method. Nonetheless, the UTXO set, i.e. the database that keeps
track of who owns which coins, shrinks because you spend more UTXOs
than you create. This alleviates the burden for full nodes to maintain
their UTXO sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, however, these two techniques of <em>UTXO management</em> could
be bad for your own or your payees&#8217; privacy. In the batching case, each
payee will know that all the batched outputs are from you to other payees
(except possibly the change). In the UTXO consolidation case, you will
reveal that the outputs you consolidate belong to the same wallet. So
you may have to make a trade-off between cost efficiency and privacy.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="layeredscaling"><a class="anchor" href="#layeredscaling"></a>8.2.4. Layered scaling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most impactful approach to scaling is probably layering. The
general idea behind layering is that a protocol can settle payments
between users without adding transactions to the blockchain.
This was already discussed briefly in <a href="#trustlessness">Chapter 2</a> and
<a href="#privacymeasures">Section 3.7</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A layered protocol begins with two or more people agreeing
on a start transaction that&#8217;s put on the blockchain, as illustrated in
<a href="#fig-scaling-layer">Figure 12</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig-scaling-layer" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scaling-layer.png" alt="scaling layer">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 12. A typical layer 2 protocol on top of Bitcoin, layer 1.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How this start transaction is created varies between protocols, but a
common theme is that the participants create an unsigned start
transaction and a number of pre-signed punishment
transactions, that spend the output of the start transaction in various
ways. Subsequently, the start transaction is fully signed and published to the
blockchain, and the punishment transactions can be fully signed and
published to punish a misbehaving party. This
incentivizes the participants to keep their promises so that the
protocol can work in a trustless way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the start transaction is on the blockchain, the protocol can do
what it&#8217;s supposed to do. For instance, it could do super fast payments between
participants, implement some privacy-enhancing techniques, or do more
advanced scripting that would not be supported by the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won&#8217;t detail how specific protocols work, but as
you can see in <a href="#fig-scaling-layer">Figure 12</a>, the blockchain is rarely used
during the protocol&#8217;s life cycle. All the juicy action happens
<em>off-chain</em>. We&#8217;ve seen how this can be a win for privacy
if done right, but it can also be an advantage for scalability.</p>

multiple stages or otherwise the rocket equation will eat your
lunch&#8230;&#8203; packing everyone in clown-car style into a trebuchet and
hoping for success is right out.&#8221;, Gregory Maxwell explains why
layering is our best shot at getting Bitcoin to scale by orders of
magnitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He starts by emphasizing the fallacy in viewing Visa or Mastercard as
Bitcoin&#8217;s main competitors and highlighting how increasing the maximum block size
is a bad approach to meet said competition. Then he talks about
how to make some real difference by using layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So-- Does that mean that Bitcoin can&#8217;t be a big winner as a payments
technology? No. But to reach the kind of capacity required to serve
the payments needs of the world we must work more intelligently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in
secure ways through its smart contracting capability (What, do you
think that was just put there so people could wax-philosophic about
meaningless "DAOs"?). In effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a
highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct
most of our business outside of the court room-- but transact in such
a way that if something goes wrong we have all the evidence and
established agreements so we can be confident that the robotic court
will make it right. (Geek sidebar: If this seems impossible, go read
this old post on transaction cut-through)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is possible precisely because of the core properties of
Bitcoin. A censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable
to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of&#8230;&#8203; and
if the underlying asset isn&#8217;t sound, there is little point in
transacting with it at all.</p>

<p>The analogy with the judge is quite illustrative of how layering
works: this judge must be incorruptible and never change her
mind, otherwise the layers above Bitcoin&#8217;s base layer will not work
reliably.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He continues by making a point about centralized services. There&#8217;s usually no
problem with trusting a central server with trivial amounts of Bitcoin
to get things done: that&#8217;s also layered scaling.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many years have passed since Maxwell wrote the piece above, and his
words still stand correct. The success of the Lightning Network proves
that layering is indeed a way forward to increase the utility of

that helping altcoins and even scamcoins defend themselves against security
exploits was a moral duty.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not enough to defend bitcoin and its users from active threats,
there is a more general responsibility to defend all kinds of users
and different software from many kinds of threats in whatever forms,
even if folks are using stupid and insecure software that you
personally don&#8217;t maintain or contribute to or advocate for. Handling
knowledge of a vulnerability is a delicate matter and you might be
receiving knowledge with more serious direct or indirect impact than
originally described.</p>

<p>He also mentions how &#8220;it&#8217;s somewhat incorrect to call this thread
anything about disclosure, this thread is not about
disclosure. Disclosure is when you tell the vendor.  This thread is
about publication and that has very different
implications. Publication is when you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve told the
prospective attackers&#8221;. This last observation concerning the distinction
between disclosure and publication is an important one. The easy part
is responsible disclosure; the hard part is sensible publishing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On July 28, 2010, a pseudonymous person by the name ArtForz discovered a

anyone else. ArtForz <em>responsibly</em> reported this to Satoshi Nakamoto and to
another Bitcoin developer named Gavin Andresen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem was that the script operator <code>OP_RETURN</code> would simply exit
the program execution, so if the scriptPubKey was <code>&lt;pubkey&gt;
OP_CHECKSIG</code> and scriptSig was <code>OP_1 OP_RETURN</code>, the part of the
program in the scriptPubKey would never execute. The only thing that
would happen would be for <code>1</code> to be put on the stack and then <code>OP_RETURN</code>
would cause the program to exit. Any non-zero value on top of the
stack after the program has executed means that the spending condition
is fulfilled. Since the top stack element <code>1</code> is non-zero, the
spending would be OK.</p>

<p>Note the difference in the characterization of the problem from the
first message: &#8220;could be displayed as accepted&#8221; vs &#8220;could be
accepted&#8221;. Maybe Satoshi downplayed the severity of the bug in his communication
so as not to draw too much attention to the actual issue. Anyhow, people
upgraded to 0.3.6 and it worked as expected. This particular
issue was resolved, amazingly, with no bitcoin losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Satoshi&#8217;s message also described some performance optimization for
mining. It&#8217;s unclear why that was included in a critical security fix,
it&#8217;s possible that the purpose was to obfuscate the real issue. However, it
seems more likely that he just released whatever was on the head of
the development branch of the Subversion repository, with the security fix
added to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At that time, there weren&#8217;t nearly as many users as there are today,

played out today, it would be considered a complete shit-show for
multiple reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satoshi made a binary-only release of 0.3.5 containing the fix. No
patch or code was provided, maybe as a measure to obfuscate the issue.</p>

<li>
<p>0.3.5 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=626.msg6455#msg6455">didn&#8217;t even work</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another debatable thing is whether it&#8217;s good or bad that
users were asked to shut down their nodes. This wouldn&#8217;t be doable
today, but at that time lots of users were actively following the
forums for updates and were usually on top of things. Given that it
was possible to do this, it might have been a sensible thing to do.</p>

3) Upgrade.<br>
4) It should start out with less than 74000 blocks. Let it redownload the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use knightmb&#8217;s files, you could just delete your

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He wanted people to download block data from a specific user, namely
knightmb, who had published his blockchain as it appeared on his disk,
the files blkXXXX.dat and blkindex.dat. The reason for downloading the
blockchain data this way, as opposed to synchronizing from scratch, was
to reduce network bandwidth bottlenecks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a big caveat with this: the data users would download from
knightmb <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/113682/69518">weren&#8217;t
verified by the Bitcoin software</a> at startup. The blkindex.dat file
contained the UTXO set, and the software would accept any data therein
as if it had already verified it. knightmb could have manipulated the
data to give himself or anyone else some bitcoins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, people seemed to go along with this, and the reversal of the
invalid block and its successors was successful. Miners started
working on a new successor to block
<a href="https://mempool.space/block/0000000000606865e679308edf079991764d88e8122ca9250aef5386962b6e84">74637</a>
and, according to the block&#8217;s timestamp, a successor appeared at 23:53
UTC, about 6 hours after the issue was discovered. At 08:10 the following day, on August
16, around block 74689, the new chain had overtaken the old
chain, therefore all non-upgraded nodes reorged to follow the new
chain. This is the deepest reorg - 52 blocks - in Bitcoin&#8217;s history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to the OP_RETURN issue, this issue was handled in a somewhat
cleaner way:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No binary-only patch release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The released software worked as intended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No hard fork</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users were asked to stop mining during this issue as well. We can discuss whether
this is a good idea or not, but imagine you&#8217;re a miner and you&#8217;re
convinced that any blocks on top of the bad block will eventually get
wiped out in a deep reorg: why would you waste resources on mining
doomed blocks?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might also think that it&#8217;s a bit fishy to do as suggested by
Nakamoto and download the blockchain, including the UTXO set, from a
random dude&#8217;s hard drive. If so, you&#8217;re right: that is fishy. But, given the circumstances, this emergency response was a
sensible one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s an important difference between this case and
the previous OP_RETURN case: this issue was exploited in the wild, and

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very interesting an educationally valuable issue surfaced in March
2013. It appeared that the blockchain had split (although the word
&#8220;fork&#8221; is used in the quote below) after block 225429. The details
of this incident were
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki">reported
in BIP50</a>. The summary says:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than
previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able
to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an
unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain
(from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the
mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as
would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in
total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild
and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools
would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on
the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8
nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Various Bitcoin Core developers<br>
<cite>BIP50 (2013)</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quick action that the mining pools BTCGuild and Slush took was
imperative in this emergency. They were ablt to tip the majority of the hash power
over to the pre-0.8 branch of the split, and thus help restore
consensus. This gave developers the time to figure out a sustainable fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s also very interesting in this issue is that version 0.7.2 was
incompatible with itself, as was the case with prior
versions too. This is explained in the
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki#root-cause">Root
cause section of BIP50</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the insufficiently high BDB lock configuration, it implicitly had
become a network consensus rule determining block validity (albeit an
inconsistent and unsafe rule, since the lock usage could vary from
node to node).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Various Bitcoin Core developers<br>
<cite>BIP50 (2013)</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, the issue is that the number of database locks the Bitcoin
Core software needs to verify a block is not deterministic. One node
might need X locks while another node might need X+1 locks. The nodes
also have a limit on how many locks Bitcoin can take. If the number of
locks needed exceeds the limit, the block will be considered
invalid. So if X+1 exceeds the limit but not X, then the two nodes
will split the blockchain and disagree on which branch is valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution chosen, apart from the immediate actions taken by the two pools to
restore consensus, was to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>limit the blocks in terms of both size and locks needed on version
0.8.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>patch old versions (0.7.2 and some older ones) with the same new
rules, and increase the global lock limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except for the increased global lock limit in the second bullet, these rules were
implemented temporarily for a pre-determined amount of time. The plan was to
remove these limits once most nodes had upgraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This soft fork dramatically reduced the risk of consensus failure, and
a few months later, on May 15, the temporary rules were deactivated in
concert across the network. Note that this deactivation was in effect
a hard fork, but it was not contentious. Furthermore, it was released
along with the preceding soft fork, so people running the soft-forked
software were well aware that a hard fork would follow it. Therefore, the vast
majority of nodes remained in consensus when the hard fork got activated.
Unfortunately, though, a few nodes that didn&#8217;t upgrade were lost in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One might wonder if this would be doable today. The mining
landscape is more complex today, and, depending on the hash power on
each side of the split, it might be hard to roll out a patch such as
the one in BIP50 quickly enough. It&#8217;d probably be hard to convince
miners on the &#8220;wrong&#8221; branch to let go of their block rewards.</p>

<p>Without anyone knowing about the issue, it could have been resolved by
the now widthdrawn BIP62, which was a proposal to reduce the
possibilities of transaction malleability. Among the proposed changes
in BIP62 were tightening of the consensus rules for the encoding of
signatures, or &#8220;strict DER encoding&#8221;. Pieter Wuille proposed some
tweaks to the BIP in July 2014, that would have solved the issue:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2014-Jul-18: In order to make Bitcoin&#8217;s signature encoding rules not
depend on OpenSSL&#8217;s specific parser, I modified the BIP62 proposal to
have its strict DER signatures requirement also apply to version 1
transactions. No non-DER signatures were being mined into blocks
anymore at the time, so this was assumed to not have any impact. See
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/90" class="bare">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/90</a> and
<a href="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-July/006299.html" class="bare">http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-July/006299.html</a>.
Unknown at the time, but if deployed this would have solved the
vulnerability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the breadth of this BIP, which covered substantially more than
just &#8220;strict DER encoding&#8221;, it was constantly changing and never got
near deployment. The BIP was later withdrawn because Segregated
Witness, BIP141, solved transaction malleability in a different and
more complete way.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_after_discovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_after_discovery"></a>After discovery</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenSSL released new versions of their software with patches that, if
used in Bitcoin since the beginning, would have solved the
issue. However, using any new version of OpenSSL only in a
new release of Bitcoin Core would make matters worse. Gregory Maxwell
explains this in another
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-January/007097.html">email thread</a> in January 2015:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While for most applications it is generally acceptable to eagerly
reject some signatures, Bitcoin is a consensus system where all
participants must generally agree on the exact validity or
invalidity of the input data.  In a sense, consistency is more
important than &#8220;correctness&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The patches above, however, only fix one symptom of the general
problem: relying on software not designed or distributed for
consensus use (in particular OpenSSL) for consensus-normative
behavior.  Therefore, as an incremental improvement, I propose
a targeted soft-fork to enforce strict DER compliance soon,
utilizing a subset of BIP62.</p>
</div>

&#8212; Gregory Maxwell on OpenSSL upgrade<br>
<cite>Bitcoin-dev mailing list</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He points out that using code that&#8217;s not intended for use in consensus
systems poses serious risks, and proposes that Bitcoin implements
strict DER encoding. This is a very clear example of the importance of
good selection cryptography, a term we discussed in <a href="#selectioncryptography">Section 7.4</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These events might give you the impression that Gregory Maxwell knew
about the vulnerability Pieter Wuille later published, but wanted to
help sneak in a fix disguised as a precaution measure, without drawing
too much attention to the actual problem. It might be so, but it&#8217;s
purely speculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, as proposed by Maxwell, BIP66 was created as a subset of BIP62 that
specified only strict DER encoding. This BIP was apparently broadly
accepted and deployed in July, albeit two blockchain splits ironically
occurred due to <em>validationless mining</em>. These splits are discussed in
the next section.</p>

<img src="images/bip66-timeline-2.png" alt="bip66 timeline 2" width="75%">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key takeaway from this is that BIPs should be more or less
<em>atomic</em>, meaning that they should be complete enough to provide something useful or solve a
specific problem, but small enough to allow for broad support among
users. The more stuff you put into a BIP, the smaller the chance of
acceptance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="bip66splits"><a class="anchor" href="#bip66splits"></a>Splits due to validationless mining</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the story of BIP66 didn&#8217;t end there. When BIP66 was
activated, it turned out quite messy because some miners didn&#8217;t verify
the blocks they were trying to extend. This is called validationless mining,
or SPV-mining (as in Simplified Payment Verification). An alert
message was sent out to Bitcoin nodes with a link to
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining">a web page
describing the issue</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early morning on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was
reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded
5%) mined an invalid block–as was an expected
occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network
hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV
mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.</p>

issue got resolved at 03:50 the same day, after 6 invalid blocks had been
