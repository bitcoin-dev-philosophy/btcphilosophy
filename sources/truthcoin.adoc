A discussion of Bitcoin’s ability to resist 51% attacks (ie, its
“security budget”). Competition makes it difficult for one network to
collect enough fees – instead, we should try to collect fees from all
networks.
____

This post is a somewhat more-empirical sequel to
http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blockspace-demand/[“Two Types of
Blockspace Demand”]. And to my
http://www.drivechain.info/literature/index.html#bob[Building-on-Bitcoin
talk].

===== 1. The “Security Budget”

Bitcoin’s
https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-security-in-one-chart-694ee3ed8c2d[“security
budget”] is the total amount of money we pay to miners (or, if you
prefer, the total amount spent _on_ mining – they are the same thing).
When this value is low, 51% attacks are cheap. In 2018, BTC’s security
budget was
https://www.blockchain.com/charts/miners-revenue?timespan=2years&daysAverageString=7[about
$7 million per day]. So, the suppression of BTC (via a never-ending
campaign of 51% attacks) would cost –at most– $2.6 billion per year.

$2.6 B is pretty low – by comparison, the 2017 annual US Military Budget
was $590 billion, and the
https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-ar-federal-system-budgets.htm[FED’s
annual operating expenses] totaled $5.7 billion.

===== 2. The Block Subsidy

Fortunately, we can expect the _block subsidy_ to give us more security
in the future. Even though it “halves” once every four years
(effectively falling by a factor of 0.84 per year), it hits for full
force no matter how high the BTC exchange rate climbs. As long as annual
appreciation 19%+, it fully compensates for the PP lost to the
halvening. Historically, the rate has been _much_ higher than 19% (more
like 70%+), and so the security budget has increased substantially over
time, and will continue to do so for a while.

Of course, eventually the exchange rate must stop appreciating. Even
https://coinjournal.net/research-paper-makes-case-5-8-million-bitcoin-price/[if
Bitcoin is outrageously successful], it will apparently reach a point
where it simply cannot grow faster than 1.077 per
year^https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/#fn:1[1]^ , as this
is apparently the growth in the nominal value of all the world’s money.

Here I show the growth, and ultimate decline of the security budget:

Above: Bitcoin’s security budget over time. Each row refers to a
different year. Theoretical max exchange rate from the
https://coinjournal.net/research-paper-makes-case-5-8-million-bitcoin-price/[Game
and Watch paper]. Imputed exchange rate is historical rates and growth
factors, with some manual “blending in” so as to more rapidly approach
the theoretical maximum. Defense budget extrapolated from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States[wikipedia
data]. “Safety Ratio” is the percentage of military budget that would be
needed to disable Bitcoin. All numbers are in nominal dollars.

The “indifference” epoch is one where Bitcoin is vulnerable, but few
adversaries squander their opportunity to attack because they are not
paying attention. The “healthy” epoch is one where BTC should be able to
deter 51% attacks even from ultra-wealthy motivated adversaries. But the
“decline” epoch shows us a bleak future, in which 51% attacks on Bitcoin
are easy again.

===== Transaction Fees

[[i-the-desired-fee-pressure]]
====== i. The Desired “Fee Pressure”

As is commonly known, _transaction fees_ are expected to come to the
rescue. As
https://web.archive.org/web/20171207201015/https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-wizards/2016-01-17/?msg=58099943&page=1[Greg
Maxwell remarked]:

[source,highlight]
----
fee pressure is an intentional part of the system
design and to the best of the current understanding
essential for the system's long term survival
----

He
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html[later
famously wrote]:

[source,highlight]
----
Personally, I'm pulling out the champaign that market
behaviour is indeed producing activity levels that can
pay for security without inflation.
----

This view, (of a needed “fee pressure”), is common. Roger Ver has
https://www.docdroid.net/NG1sbVq/pantera-march-2017.pdf[compiled similar
quotes] from other Bitcoin intelligentsia. Roger did this in order to
discredit them politically, but the quotes are nonetheless accurate.

[[ii-the-dual-nature]]
====== ii. The Dual Nature

The *dual nature* of Bitcoin (as both a money-unit, and a payment-rail)
has confused people since Bitcoin was first invented.

In general, monetary theorists and economics ignored the payment-rail
(and dismissed Bitcoin as supposedly having “no intrinsic value”).
Businessmen and bankers ignored the money-unit (and regarded purchases
_of BTC_ as hopelessly naive), and instead tried hopelessly to rip-off
the “blockchain technology”.

The confusion persists today in the “scaling debate”, in the form of a
discussion over whether or not the “medium of exchange” use-cases are
more valuable than the “store of value” use-cases.

And I think it persists in long-run security budget analysis, as well.
Consider the following table:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|*Revenue Source* |*Block Subsidy (12.5 BTC)* |*Transaction Fees*
|*Market’s Units* |…of BTC |…of block space
|*Price Units* |… $ (PPP) per BTC |$ (PPP) per byte
|*If BTC price = moon…* |…SB Goes Up |…SB _Unaffected_
|*Meme* |Store of Value |Medium of Exchange
|*Slogan* |“Digital Gold” |“P2P Electronic Cash”
|===

While the two are mixed into the same “security budget”, the *block
subsidy and txn-fees are utterly and completely different*. They are as
different from each other, as “VISA’s total profits in 2017” are from
the “total increase in https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp[M2]
in 2017”.

VISA’s profits are a function of how cost-effectively VISA provides
value to its customers, relative to its competitors (MasterCard, ACH,
WesternUnion, etc). Changes in M2 are a function of other things
entirely, such as: election outcomes, public opinion, business cycles,
and FED decisions. There is some sense in which M2 “competes” with the
Japanese Yen, but there are really no senses in which it competes with
MasterCard.

[[iii-are-fees-truly-paid-in-btc]]
====== iii. Are fees truly paid “in BTC”?

Transaction fees are explicitly priced in BTC. But, unlike the block
reward, they _do_ react to changes in the exchange rate. As the exchange
rate rises, a given satoshi/byte fee rate becomes more onerous, and
people shy away from paying it.

And so tx-fees are not really “priced in BTC”, despite the protocol’s
attempt to mislead us into thinking that they are. They are actually
priced in http://www.truthcoin.info/images/true-money/[purchasing
power], which –these days (pre-hyper-bitcoinization)– is best expressed
in US Dollars.

So, it is entirely appropriate
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/big-transactions-fees-are-a-problem-for-bitcoin.html[to
say], for example, that “in Dec 2017, BTC had tx-fees as high as
_twenty-eight dollars_”. And it would be inappropriate to say that the
tx-fees were “as high as .0015,0000 BTC”. For if the BTC price had been
10x higher^https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/#fn:2[2]^,
the tx-fees would have only reached .0001,5000 BTC.

[[iv-stimulating-production]]
====== iv. Stimulating Production

Whenever prices rise, entrepreneurs are induced to produce. (Owners are
also induced to sell, but we are not interested in that right now.)

The supply of BTC is famously capped at 21 million. The _produced_
supply (aka the “new” supply) is currently capped at 12.5 BTC per block,
until the next halving.

The supply of a completely different good, “btc-block-bytes”, is also
capped. It was first (in)famously capped at 1 MB per block, and now is
capped at
https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Block_weight#Conversion_to_real_sizes[something-like]
2.3 MB per block.

As was just said: whenever blocks become more valuable, entrepreneurs
search for ways to produce more of them.

One way is to reactivate older, marginally unprofitable mining hardware.
Production then hastens…temporarily. Of course, after the next
difficulty adjustment, block-production will return to its equilibrium
rate (of 1 block per 10 minutes).

Alternatively, entrepreneurs can create, and mine, Altcoins.

[[v-altcoins-as-substitute-goods]]
====== v. Altcoins as Substitute Goods

Alt-“coins” are _very poor_ substitutes for Bit-“coins”. Each form of
money, is necessarily in competition with all other forms: money has
strong network effects; the recognizability property has super-linear
returns to scale; exchange rates are transaction frictions that are
inconvenient; etc. What people wanted was a BTC. They wanted to _get rid
of_ all their other forms of money!

But it is the reverse when we consider transaction fees and
“btc-block-bytes”: Altcoin-blockspace is a pretty good substitute for
Bitcoin-blockspace. Remember that this type of demand has _nothing to
do_ with obtaining BTC. Users merely wish to buy something using the
Bitcoin payment-rail. This image from
https://www.fincen.gov/news/testimony/statement-jennifer-shasky-calvery-director-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-0[2013
FINCEN Congressional testimony] hopefully makes it clear:

image::round-trip.png[]

Since the amount of coin sent in a blockchain payment is always
configurable, it will always be possible to send someone “twenty
dollars” worth of LTC; or “one BTC” worth of DOGE; or “one sandwich”
worth of EOS. All of this is made much easier by the “exchangers” (ie:
Coinbase, ShapeShift, SideShift, BitPay, LocalBitcoins, multi-currency
wallets, CC ATMs, etc) which now take numerous forms and are easy to
use.

Furthermore, this (true) premise –that Altcoin-payments are indeed
substitutes for Bitcoin-payments– is occasionally explicitly
admitted^https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/#fn:3[3]^, even
by hardcore maximalists. Especially during the last fee run-up in late
2017:

digital currency for payments”]

[[vi-competitive-demand-for-the-payment-rail]]
====== vi. Competitive Demand for the Payment Rail

The supposedly-essential “fee pressure” has, for the moment, deserted
us.

See this graph (from https://core.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,all[this
page]) for BTC-priced fees:

image::pending-btc-fees.png[image]

And this graph (from https://bitcoinfees.info/[this page]) for
USD-priced fees:

image::pending-btc-fees-usd.png[image]

We see that fee pressure has crumbled. Today,
https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/fee-calculator/[a typical
transaction will cost] 30-40 cents – much cheaper than a VISA txn.

Compare the
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-sma90.html#log[historical
data, given in 90-day moving-average]…

image::btc-fees-alltime-ma.png[image]

…to the two graphs below:

image::btc-decline.png[image]

We see that BTC’s crossing of the “1 USD per transaction line”, in May
of 2017, coincides with the rise of Altcoins. We also see that the
“pressure” of late 2017 quickly canceled itself out, and then some.
Finally, we see that this release-of-pressure coincided with a sudden
(and unprecedented) decline in BTC-transactions.

To me, this data refutes the theory that users will pay high BTC fees
willingly. In fact, they seem to have only ever paid high fees
_unwillingly_ – during a brief “bubble” time (of relative panic and
FOMO).

If that theory is indeed false, then total fees will not be any higher
–in USD terms– than they are today.

According to
https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees-usd?timespan=2years[blockchain.info],
fees in the last 12 months totaled $70 million. (In the 12 months before
_that_, they were $770 million).

Revisit the
https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget#2-the-block-subsidy[chart
above], and you will see that this barely registers. After all, when $70
M is priced in the units of the chart (billions), it is just $0.07.

If the consumer is cost-conscious, and will only pay the lowest tx-fees,
then how can we get those numbers up?

[[vii-alternative-fee-sources]]
====== vii. Alternative Fee-Sources

[[a-lightning-network]]
*a. Lightning Network*

The Lightning Network (if successful) will allow very many “real-life
transactions” to be fit into just two on-chain txns.

The immediate effect of this, is to _lower_ on-chain transaction fees;
but the ultimate effect is increase them. LN boosts on-chain fees by
increasing the utility of each on-chain txn (by allowing each to do the
work of many txns), and by therefore making high on-chain fees more
tolerable to the end user.

Exactly how much will LN boost fees?

At this point – it is anyone’s guess. But _my_ guess is that they cannot
realistically increase by more than two orders of magnitude.

First, on-chain txns are needed to create, and periodically maintain,
the LN. So LN-users will still be paying on-chain fees; and will still
prefer to minimize these costs. Meanwhile, Altcoins will have their own
Lightning Network (they will copy LN, just as they’ve copied everything
else). All of these LNs will compete with each other, the same way that
different blockchains compete with each other.

Keep in mind, that the fees paid to
LN-hubs^https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/#fn:n[4]^ will,
by definition, _not_ be paid to miners. So, there is no sense in which
LN-fees “accumulate” into one big on-chain txn-fee (in contrast to how
_the economic effect_ of each LN-txn _does_ accumulate into a single net
on-chain txn).

Second, the LN user-experience will probably always be worse than the
on-chain user-experience. LN is _interactive_, meaning that users must
be online, and do something [sign a transaction] in order to receive
money. It also means that your LN-counterparties can inconvenience you
(for example if they stop replying, or if their computers catch fire) or
outright harass you. LN also comes with new risks – the LN-design is
very clever at minimizing these risks, but they are still there and will
still be annoying to users. Users will prefer not to put up with them.
So they will tend to prefer an Altcoin on-chain-txn over a
mainchain-LN-txn.

[[b-merged-mined-sidechains]]
*b. Merged-Mined Sidechains*

Merged-Mined Sidechains do whatever Altcoins can do, but without the
need to purchase a new token. So they have infinitely lower exchange
rate risk, and are more convenient for users.

On top of that, MM SCs send all txn-fees they collect to Bitcoin miners.
Under http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/[Blind Merged
Mining], they do this without requiring any users or miners to run the
sidechain node software.

A set of http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/gigachain/[largeblock
sidechains] could process very many transactions. In the next section, I
will assume that the total Sidechain Network replaces VISA, (and VISA
alone), and captures all of its transaction fee revenues. VISA is only a
small percentage of the total payments market (which includes checks,
WesternUnion, ApplePay, etc), but it is a good first look.

[[viii-visas-transaction-fee-revenues]]
====== viii. VISA’s Transaction Fee Revenues

Contrary to what I believed just moments before looking this up, VISA
does not earn any money off of the interest that it charges its
customers.

Observe page 40 of
http://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NYSE_V_2017.pdf[their
most recent annual report]:

[source,highlight]
----
Our operating revenues are primarily generated from
payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods
and services, as well as the number of transactions
processed on our network. We do not earn revenues
from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest
or fees paid by account holders on Visa products.
----

Instead VISA’s revenue comes from transaction fees. This perfectly
facilitates our comparison.

Total revenues were 18,538 $M in 2017, up from 11,778 $M in 2013. This
corresponds to quite an annual growth rate – 12% per year.

If we assume that current trends holds, we get the following:

image::security-budget-fees.png[]

https://www.truthcoin.info/images/long-run-security-budget.xlsx[Link to
Excel sheet].

Above: The ‘security budget table’ from earlier in this post, plus a new
column: VISA transaction fees. These fees are added to the base block
subsidy amounts, to get a new total security budget.

This security budget _does_ seem to be much safer in the long run, and
safer in general.

===== Conclusion

To deter 51% attacks, Bitcoin needs a high “security budget”. Today’s
tx-fee revenues are not high enough; we must ensure that they are
“boosted” in the future.

Higher prices (ie, higher satoshi/byte fee-rates) are one way of
boosting revenue. Unfortunately, competition from rival chains acts to
suppress the market-clearing fee-rate.

A better way, is to attempt to devour the entire payments market, and
claim all of its fee revenues. This can be done using Merge Mined
Sidechains, without any decentralization loss.
