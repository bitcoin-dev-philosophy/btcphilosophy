Public blockchains are empirically secure. For most of their
(admittedly, short) history they did what they were designed to do,
processing transactions without any hiccups. That we can observe. It is
harder to come up with a theory of why it’s the case.

Individuals typically explain their pet project’s security with whatever
they personally understand and value the most. Depending on who you ask,
a public blockchain is either secured by economic incentives, by
globally distributed hashpower, by full nodes, or by a rabid community
upholding a shared set of values. That’s not entirely surprising:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument[The law of the
instrument] suggests that we over-rely on tools that are already
familiar to us. If your only tool is a hammer, to tend to treat
everything as a nail.

I don’t think any of the above factors can explain the phenomenon all on
their own. It is too easy to come up with attacks that succeed in spite
of perfect protection in one particular area. For example, in a network
where all users run a full node, a miner could still replace the entire
blockchain with an alternate one where he controls all of the coins. So
it must be the combination and interplay of the different parts that
generate the amount of security needed for a permissionless digital cash
system.

===== The onion model of blockchain security

The model I propose hopes to synthesize the individual elements of
security into a coherent picture. The goal is to look at public
blockchain more holistically, detect strengths and weaknesses, and allow
the comparison of different blockchains.

*The security of a public blockchain resembles an onion, where each
layer adds additional security:*

To permanently destroy a public blockchain, it is necessary to destroy
the faith of users in its ledger state (the list of ownership) as well
as the ability to reliably update that state going forward. All higher
layers serve to prevent this from happening.

image::space-of-possible-attack.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

Attacks have to pass through this funnel of defensive layers before
touching the core. We now discuss the layers one by one.

===== Cryptographic guarantees

The outermost shield is provided by cryptographic guarantees.
Cryptography gives the most reliable form of guarantee, so we want it to
do the heavy lifting and prevent most attacks from the get-go.
Cryptography ensures, among other things:

* No printing coins from thin air: All blocks (and hence all block
rewards) must have a sufficient proof of work attached to them.
* No spending other people’s coins: Digital signature schemes ensure
that only the valid owner of a coin can spend it.
* No retroactively changing the contents of old blocks: Hash pointers
ensure that an attacker has to change all blocks built on top of any old
block he wants to change.

All of these attacks are rejected by the first filter:

image::cryptographic-guarantees.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

But while cryptography is very powerful, there are other assurances it
cannot provide. For example, it cannot decide which of two equally long
blockchains is the “correct” one (that would require knowledge about the
real world, such as “which of them will other people switch to” and
“which of them has the higher market value in the long-term”). It also
cannot force miners to mine on a specific block, publish a block once
they found it, or even ensure they include specific transactions.

===== Consensus guarantees

Some of the attacks that pass the first layer will be stopped in the
consensus process. In Nakamoto consensus, nodes constantly observe the
network and automatically switch to the longest (most expensive) chain.
Miners only get paid if their blocks end up being part of that longest
chain, so they need to converge with the other miners. As a result,
there is a strong bias for miners to work on the tip of the blockchain
because that’s where their block is most likely to become recognized by
everyone else.

If a rogue miner wanted to mine on a previous block, he would enter a
race condition with the rest of the miners who continue to work on the
tip of the chain. Only if he finds several blocks faster than everyone
else combined, he can catch up and then pull ahead. But depending on his
share of hashpower, he is very unlikely to succeed with even a very
shallow reorganization.

image::consensus-guarantee.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

For an attack to work reliably, an attacker needs to first obtain
control over the consensus layer. That means controlling either >50% of
hashpower in proof-of-work, >33% of stake in BFT-based proof-of-stake,
or >50% of stake in longest-chain based proof-of-stake.

The operational difficulty of this is often underestimated. For example,
large governments are typically seen as the largest risk to public
blockchains. However, if they wanted to buy the necessary hardware on
the primary markets they would quickly find that annual production is
capped by chip foundries in China, Taiwan, and South Korea. And their
capacity is further capped by rare-earth mining in Australia, wafer
production in Asia and Africa, and so on. There’s only a limited amount
of capacity available every year, even for a highly motivated buyer.
Acquiring the necessary hardware that way could take at least 2-3 years,
and would not go unnoticed.

Only China could get to 50% hashpower by confiscating existing hardware
or possibly coerce pool owners into launching a single attack. This
could work, but only until individual miners start to notice and direct
their hashpower elsewhere. While an attack like this is very unlikely to
work against Bitcoin anytime soon, smaller networks command respectively
smaller shares of hashpower or stake. In that case, the space of
possible attackers can include smaller (rogue) governments as well as
the entire private sector.

===== Economic guarantees

I’ve previously argued that thanks to economic guarantees,
https://www.coindesk.com/no-concentration-among-miners-isnt-going-to-break-bitcoin?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=twitter&utm_term=Events&utm_content=Register&utm_campaign=FATF[blockchains
don’t immediately break if a single entity controls the consensus
layer]. By setting the right incentives, blockchains can associate a
real-world cost with misbehavior. The ability to due that comes from the
native token, introducing a concept of digital scarcity (and hence
value) that can reward good behavior (with block rewards and fees) and
punish bad behavior (either by slashing security deposits or by
withholding future rewards.)

The size of these incentives scales with the level of control an actor
has over the consensus layer. An actor who controls a lot of hashpower
(even a majority) has proportionally more to lose from destroying the
system. Thereby, attacks are discouraged with economic punishment for
the attacker.

If a rogue miner wanted to mine on a previous block, he would enter a
race condition with the rest of the miners who continue to work on the
tip of the chain. Only if he finds several blocks faster than everyone
else combined, he can catch up and then pull ahead. But depending on his
share of hashpower, he is very unlikely to succeed with even a very
shallow reorganization.

image::economic-guarantees.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

Not all economic incentives are made equal. A network with a larger
block reward relative to network value is more secure because it forces
miners to have more skin in the game. (This is
https://uncommoncore.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/A-model-for-Bitcoins-security-and-the-declining-block-subsidy-v1.06.pdf[why
the declining block subsidy poses a risk to Bitcoin’s security]).

Miners also have more skin in the game when hashing requires specialized
hardware (so-called ASICs) that cannot be repurposed if the network
disappears. It is no coincidence that all mining attacks to date have
happened to smaller networks that subscribe to a fallacy called
ASIC-resistance, where control can be acquired with little, or even no
skin in the game (e.g.
https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/vertcoins-51-attack-a-case-study-for-blockchain-security/[by
renting hashpower]).

===== Social guarantees

Previously we said that to permanently destroy a public blockchain, it
is necessary to destroy the faith of users in its ledger state (the list
of ownership) as well as the ability to reliably update that state going
forward.

This is necessary because blockchains are not the ends itself. There’s
no reason to pack up and go home because some parts of it failed
temporarily. A blockchain is merely a means to automate the process of
establishing a social consensus between its participants, a tool to
maintain and update a shared database. The state of that database has
value to the participants, and they are strongly incentivized to restore
the system when it breaks.

For example, if the cryptographic hash function breaks, the social layer
can come to a manual consensus (guided by technical experts) to replace
the broken part:

image::ecdsa-breaks.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

Likewise, if a consensus attack makes it past the stage of economic
guarantees, the social layer can still manually reject it. If an
attacker with majority hashpower started to DOS the network by mining
empty blocks, in full acceptance of the economic damage to himself, then
users could decide to change the PoW function and thereby remove that
miner’s control manually.

image::social-guarantees.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

As we can see, the only way to kill a blockchain for good is to either
make users lose interest in the ledger state itself or damage the system
to a degree that it cannot possibly be fixed.

image::attacks-are-dangerous.png[image,width=1086,height=462]

Attacks are dangerous when they can pierce all the layers and ultimately
wear out the social core of the system until it can no longer override
damage to higher layers and heal.

For both the healing and the manual intervention to work, the
communities of each project need strong social conventions around their
project’s main properties. In the case of Bitcoin, these core values are
irreversibility of transactions, censorship-resistance, no
backward-incompatible changes, and the 21m token cap. They serve as
action blueprints for when social intervention becomes necessary, and
create Schelling points around what needs to be fixed and what doesn’t.

These core values of a project are perpetually renegotiated, and not all
users agree on all properties. However, the stronger the agreement
around a particular value, the more likely it can be upheld during times
of hardship.

Looking at the social layer as ground zero of any blockchain, we can see
that social engineering attacks are a big threat. Higher layers become
more vulnerable if rogue developers can sneak in detrimental code
changes without supervision, particularly in projects with frequent
hard-fork policies

===== Conclusion and future parts

I find the onion model useful to see how individual layers of a
blockchain can create a secure whole. In some ways, it builds on my
previous article on
https://medium.com/s/story/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9[Bitcoin’s
social contract]: Any public blockchain starts from a set of shared
values at the core, a blueprint for what the system hopes to achieve.

That set of values must be translated into rules of interpersonal
behavior (the protocol!). Then we enforce these rules automatically,
creating different types of guarantees: economic, consensus, and
cryptographic. By constraining the behavior of its participants, the
system becomes

low-trust environments.
