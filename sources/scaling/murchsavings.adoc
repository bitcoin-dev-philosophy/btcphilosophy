the P2TR output scripts. Thanks to Matthew Zipkin, for pointing out the
prior imprecision._

The Bitcoin community has been
https://medium.com/hackernoon/excited-for-schnorr-signatures-a00ee467fc5f[abuzz
for a few years] about bringing Schnorr signatures to Bitcoin. Since
then, the idea has evolved into three formal Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki[‘BIP340 —
Schnorr Signatures for secp256k1’],
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki[‘BIP341 —
Taproot: SegWit version 1 spending rules’], and
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki[‘BIP342 —
Validation of Taproot Scripts’]. Respectively, they define a standard
for Schnorr signatures in Bitcoin, introduce the Taproot construction,
and formalize the new Script v1 instruction set. Taproot also iterates
on the previous proposal of Merklized Alternative Script Trees (MAST).

There are two ways of spending a _pay-to-taproot_ (P2TR) output. The
first way is called _key path spending._ P2TR funds are locked to a
single public key similarly to _pay-to-public-key_ (P2PK) outputs. The
output script appears in the transaction as _‘OP_1 <pubkey>’_. This
script can be satisfied by providing an empty input script and a Schnorr
signature of the corresponding private key in the witness program. The
key path is the default spending path. It is used in single-sig and
collaborative multi-party spending.

Under the hood, the public key is a composition of an _inner key_ and
the Merkle root of a Taproot tree (the inner key is _tweaked_ with the
Merkle root). The inner key can optionally be a composite itself, for
example multiple public keys aggregated via the
https://blockstream.com/2019/02/18/en-musig-a-new-multisignature-standard/[MuSig]
scheme. These compositions are possible due to Schnorr signatures being
linear.

The second way of spending a P2TR output uses one of the Taproot leaves.
We call this _script path spending._ First, the existence of the leaf
needs to be proven which is done by revealing the inner key, the Merkle
path to the Taproot leaf, and the script encoded in the leaf. Then, the
spending conditions of the leaf’s script are fulfilled.

The remainder of this article explores the input costs of 2-of-3
multisig Taproot constructions. Some familiarity with the details of the
proposals is helpful. Check out the

looking to refresh the details.

==== The multisig user story

We are looking at a wallet construction using three keys held by two or
three parties. The first key is held by the user, the second key is held
by the service provider, and the third key is a backup key either held
by the user or a key recovery service. We are assuming that the first
two keys are hot and can be used in an interactive signing scheme as
employed by MuSig. The backup key may be held cold e.g. on an air-gapped
system in which case interactive signing should be avoided.

Classically, a 2-of-3 multisig address is constructed in the form of a
_pay-to-scripthash (P2SH)_ output of the form _‘2 <pubkey1> <pubkey2>
<pubkey3> 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG’._ This construction can logically be
expressed as ‘(A ∧ B) ∨(A ∧ C) ∨(B ∧ C)’ which could also be thought of
as “one of three 2-of-2 multisig scripts”. The latter translates nicely
to Taproot: we can encode the preferred condition of spending with the
user and the service key (the two hot keys) in an aggregated pubkey for
the key path, and put the two spending conditions using the backup key
in leaves of the Taproot tree. Two variants are explored: one where the
backup key is capable of participating in the interactive MuSig signing
scheme, another that falls back to a simpler multisig scheme where
signing is non-interactive e.g. because the backup key is air-gapped and
the multiple roundtrips required for MuSig are inconvenient.

.The most likely spending option with the two hot keys is encoded as an aggregated key in the key path. The two backup spending options are put into leaves of the script tree.

==== Key path spending costs

In the general case, all parties agree on a course of action and
collaborate to use the key path. This is the most cost-effective way to
spend a P2TR output and allows multiparty spenders (and other complex
spending conditions) to be indistinguishable from single-sig spenders.

===== Costs of key path input

An input commits to a specific _unspent transaction output (UTXO)_ which
is defined by the transaction that created it and the position in that
transaction’s output list. The UTXO entry provides the spending
conditions to be satisfied by the spender. An _nSequence_ field allows
encoding replaceability, and the witness provides the spender’s
authentication. In the case of the key path this is a single Schnorr
signature which in some cases may actually consist of multiple
aggregated signatures.

* outpoint (txid:vout): 32 vB+4 vB
* scriptSig size: 1 vB
* nSequence: 4 vB
* count witness items: 1 WU
* witness item size: 1 WU
* signature: 64 WU

32+4+1+4+(1+1+64)/4 = 57.5 vB

==== Control Blocks

When a fallback to the backup key is necessary, the existence of the
Taproot tree must be revealed. If there is only a single leaf, the
spender provides only the inner key. Tweaking the inner key with the
hashed leaf results in the public key. In sum, the data necessary to
prove the existence of a script path is called the _control block_.

===== Depth 0 control block

* Length of control block: 1 WU
* Header byte (script version, sign of output key): 1 WU
* Inner key: 32 WU

1+1+32 = 34 WU

In case of two leaves, additionally the first hashing partner for the
Merkle path must be revealed:

===== Depth 1 control block

* Length of control block: 1 WU
* Header byte: 1 WU
* Inner key of root key: 32 WU
* Hashing partner in tree: 32 WU

1+ 1+ 32 + 32 = 66 WU

==== Script path spending cost

The below costs are in addition to the above costs of spending via the
key path.

===== Script path spend assuming 2-of-2 MuSig leaf (hot backup key)

When the backup key is on a networked system, e.g. an HSM, and can
participate in a multi-roundtrip signing process, we can make use of
MuSig to aggregate the two public keys.

* script size: 1 WU
* script “<pk> OP_CHECKSIG”: 33 WU+1 WU
* Depth 1 Control block: 66 WU

57.5+(1+34+66)/4 = 82.75 vB

===== Construction with 2-of-2 OP_CHECKSIG (cold backup key, no MuSig)

In the case that the backup key is offline and a human would have to
make multiple trips employing USB sticks or QR codes, saving roundtrips
may take precedence over saving a few bytes. Instead of an aggregated
public key, we use a non-interactive multisig construction.

* second signature: 1 WU+64 WU
* script size: 1 WU
* script “<pk1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <pk2> OP_CHECKSIG” 33+1+33+1=68 WU
* Depth 1 Control block: 66 WU

57.5+(1+64+1+68+66)/4 = 107.5 vB

===== Discarded approach: single leaf with 2-of-3 script

It turns out that a single 2-of-3 leaf in lieu of the two 2-of-2 leaves
is both more costly and less private.

* +2nd sig: 1+64 WU
* +1 empty witness item: 2 WU
* Length of script: 1 WU
* Script “<pk1> OP_CHECKSIG <pk2> OP_CHECKSIGADD <pk3> OP_CHECKSIGADD 2
OP_EQUAL”: 33+1+33+1+33+1+2=104 WU
* Depth 0 Control block: 34 WU

57.5+(1+64+2+1+104+34)/4 = 109 vB

==== Conclusion

.Upper bound of input and output sizes for single-sig and 2-of-3 multisig.
image:1_wsspff_5vVlEDPyndigjZg.png[width=654,height=327]

The described 2-of-3 multisig scheme achieves input sizes of 57.5 vbytes
for a key path spend, 82.75 vbytes for the leaves using a hot backup
key, and 107.5 vbytes for non-interactive backup spends. This results in
a fee reduction by 45% for 2-of-3 inputs when switching from P2WSH to
P2TR spending. In the uncommon case of a recovery transaction, the cost
is negligibly increased for cold keys. Single-sig users are also
incentivized to switch to P2TR as they save 11 vbytes on each input —
the output cost is externalized on the sender.
