== Adversarial thinking

image::adversarialthinking-banner.jpg[]

This chapter addresses _adversarial thinking_, a mindset that focuses
on what could go wrong and how adversaries might act. We start out
by discussing Bitcoin's security assumptions and security model, after which
we explain how ordinary users can improve
their self-sovereignty and Bitcoin's full node decentralization by thinking adversarially. Then, we
look into some actual threats to Bitcoin as well as into the adversary's mind.
Lastly, we talk about the _axiom of resistance_ which
can help you understand why people are working on Bitcoin in the
first place.

When discussing security within various systems, it's important to understand
what the security assumptions are. A typical security assumption in
Bitcoin is "`the discrete logarithm problem is hard to solve`", which,
simply put, means it's practically impossible to find a private key
that corresponds to a particular public key. Another pretty strong
security assumption is that a majority of the network's hashpower is
honest, meaning that they play by the rules. If these assumptions are
proven wrong, then Bitcoin is in trouble.

In 2015 Andrew Poelstra
https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/[gave
a talk] at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, during which he
analyzed Bitcoin's security assumptions. He starts by noticing that many systems
disregard adversaries to some extent; for example, it's really hard to
protect a building against all types of adversarial events. Instead, we generally
accept the possibility that someone may burn the building down, and to some extent prevent
this and other adversarial behaviors through law enforcement etc.
// See greg maxwell's analogy of the building: https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2799

But online things are different:

[quote, Andrew Poelstra, Security Assumptions at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong (2015)]
____
However, online we don’t have this. We have pseudonymous and anonymous
behavior, anyone can connect to everyone and hurt the system. If it’s
possible to adversarially hurt the system, then they will do it. We
cannot assume they will be visible and that they will be caught.
____

The consequence is that all known weaknesses in Bitcoin must somehow be taken
care of, otherwise they will be exploited. After all, Bitcoin
is the greatest honey pot in the world.

Poelstra goes on to mention how Bitcoin is a new kind of system; it's
more nebulous than, for example, a signing protocol which has very
clear-cut security assumptions.

On his personal blog, software engineer Jameson Lopp,
https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/[dives into this]:

[quote, Jameson Lopp, Bitcoin’s Security Model: A Deep Dive (2016)]
____
In reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a
formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can
do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system
in order to better understand and attempt to describe it.
____

So, we have a system that seems to be working in practice, but that we can't
formally prove to be secure. A proof is probably not possible due to
the complexity of the system itself.

The importance of adversarial thinking also extends to everyday
Bitcoin users to some degree, not only to hardcore Bitcoin developers and experts. 
Ragnar Lifthasir mentions in a
https://bitcoinwords.github.io/tweetstorm-on-adversarial-thinking[tweetstorm] how simplistic narratives around
Bitcoin - for example, "`just HODL`" - can be degrading to Bitcoin itself, and
concludes by saying

[quote, Ragnar Lifthasir, Twitter (2020)]
____
To make Bitcoin and ourselves stronger we need to think like the
software engineers who contribute to Bitcoin. They peer review,
mercilessly seeking flaws. At their tech events they talk about every
which way a proposal can fail. They think adversarially. They’re
conservative
____

He refers to these simplistic narratives as monomanias. Through this definition he's saying that by
focusing on a single thing - for example, "`just HODL`"- you risk to overlook 
the arguably more important stuff, such as keeping your Bitcoin secure or doing your
best to use Bitcoin in a trustless manner.

There are a lot of known weaknesses in Bitcoin, and many of them are
actively being exploited. To get a glimpse of that, have a look at the
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses[Weaknesses page] on
Bitcoin wiki. There are mentioned a wide variety of problems, such as
wallet theft and denial-of-service attacks.

[quote, Various authors, Bitcoin wiki]
____
If an attacker attempts to fill the network with clients that they
control, you would then be very likely to connect only to attacker
nodes. Although Bitcoin never uses a count of nodes for anything,
completely isolating a node from the honest network can be helpful in
the execution of other attacks.
____

This type of attack is called _Sybil attack_, and it occurs whenever a
single entity controls multiple nodes in a network and uses them to appear
as multiple entities.

As the quote also mentions, the Sybil attack is not effective on the
Bitcoin network because there is no voting through nodes or other numerable entities, but rather
through computing power (see <<minerdecentralization>>). Nonetheless, this flat
structure leaves the system susceptible to other attacks.
The Bitcoin wiki page also outlines other possible attacks, such as information hiding
(often referred to as _eclipse attack_), and the way Bitcoin Core implements
some heuristic countermeasures against such attacks.

The above are examples of real threats that need to be taken care of.

[[sabotage]]
To better understand the adversary's mind, it might be helpful to
get a glimpse into how they operate. A US government body named
Office of Strategic Services, which operated during World War II and had among its purposes to
conduct espionage, perform sabotage and spread propaganda,
produced a https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184[manual]
for their personnel on how to properly sabotage the enemy. Its title was "`Simple
Sabotage Field Manual`" and contained concrete tips on infiltrating
the enemy to make their lives hard. The tips range from burning
down warehouses to causing wear to drills in order to decrease the enemy's
efficiency.

For example, there is a section (<<fig-sabotage-manual>>) about how an
infiltrator can disrupt organizations. It's not hard to see how such
tactics could be used to target the Bitcoin development process (see
<<opensource>>), which is open for anyone to participate in. A
dedicated attacker can keep stalling progress by endless concerns of
irrelevant issues, haggle over precise wordings, and attempt to reiterate discussions
that have already been comprehensively addressed. The attacker can also hire
a troll army to multiply their own effectiveness; we can call this a social
Sybil attack. Using a social Sybil attack, they can make it look like there's
more resistance against a proposed change than there actually is.

This highlights how a determined state can and will do everything in
its power to destroy the enemy, including breaking it down from
the inside. Since Bitcoin is a form of money that competes with
established fiat currencies, chances are that states will regard
Bitcoin as an enemy.

[[axiomofresistance]]
Eric Voskuil
https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Axiom-of-Resistance[writes
on his Cryptoeconomics wiki page] about what he calls the "`axiom of
resistance`":

[quote, Eric Voskuil, Cryptoeconomics wiki (2017)]
____
In other words there is an assumption that it is _possible_ for a
system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but
deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to empirical study of
behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.

*One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an
entirely different system than Bitcoin.* If one assumes it is _not
possible_ for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not
make sense in the context of Bitcoin - just as conclusions in
spherical geometry contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be
permissionless or censorship-resistant without the axiom? The
contradiction leads one to make obvious errors in an attempt to
rationalize the conflict.
____

What he's essentially saying is that only when one assumes it's possible to
create a system that states can't control, is it meaningful to try.

This means that to work on Bitcoin you should accept the axiom of
resistance, otherwise you'd better spend your time on other
projects. Acknowledging that axiom helps you focusing your development
efforts on the real problems at hand: coding around state-level
adversaries. In other words, think adversarially.

=== Conclusion

A decentralized system can't have accountability outside the system
itself, therefore Bitcoin must prevent malicious behavior more
rigorously than traditional systems. Adversarial thinking is
imperative in such a system.

To keep Bitcoin safe you need to know its enemies and their
incentives. Most of the threats seem to boil down to nation states,
who have enourmous economic power, through taxation and money
printing. They probably won't give up their money printing privileges
easily.
