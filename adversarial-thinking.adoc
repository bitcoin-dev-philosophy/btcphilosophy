== Adversarial thinking

When we discuss security in various systems, it's good to understand
what the security assumptions are. A typical security assumption in
Bitcoin is "the Discrete Logarithm problem is hard to solve", which,
simply put, means it's practically impossible to find a private key
that corresponds to a particular public key. Another, pretty strong,
security assumption is that a majority of the network's hashpower is
honest, meaning that they play by the rules. If these assumptions are
proven wrong, then Bitcoin is in trouble.

Andrew Poelstra
https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/[gave
a talk] at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong 2015, where he
talked about Bitcoin's security assumptions. He says that many systems
disregard adversaries to some extent; for example, it's really hard to
protect a building against all types of adversarial events. Instead we
accept that someone may burn the building down, and we prevent
adversarial behavior to some extent through law enforcement etc.
// See greg maxwell's analogy of the building: https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2799

But online things are different:

[quote, Andrew Poelstra, Scaling Bitcoin, Hong Kong 2015]
____
However, online we don’t have this. We have pseudonymous and anonymous
behavior, anyone can connect to everyone and hurt the system. If it’s
possible to adversarially hurt the system, then they will do it. We
cannot assume they will be visible and that they will be caught.
____

The consequence is that all known weaknesses in Bitcoin must be taken
care of somehow; otherwise, they will be exploited. After all, Bitcoin
is the greatest honey pot in the world.

Poelstra goes on to mention how Bitcoin is a new kind of system; it's
more nebulous than, for example, a signing protocol which has very
clear-cut security assumptions.

On his personal blog, software engineer Jameson Lopp,
https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/[dives into this]:

[quote, Jameson Lopp, Bitcoin’s Security Model: A Deep Dive]
____
In reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a
formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can
do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system
in order to better understand and attempt to describe it.
____

So we have a system that seems to be working in practice, but we can't
formally prove it's secure. A proof is probably not possible due to
the complexity of the system.

=== Not just for experts

The importance of adversarial thinking probably extends to the general
public as well to some
degree. https://bitcoinwords.github.io/tweetstorm-on-adversarial-thinking[Ragnar
Lifthasir mentions in a tweetstorm] how simplistic narratives around
Bitcoin, for example "just HODL", can be degrading to Bitcoin and
concludes

[quote, Ragnar Lifthasir, Twitter]
____
To make Bitcoin and ourselves stronger we need to think like the
software engineers who contribute to Bitcoin. They peer review,
mercilessly seeking flaws. At their tech events they talk about every
which way a proposal can fail. They think adversarially. They’re
conservative
____

He refers to these simplistic narratives as monomania, meaning that by
focusing only on a single thing, eg "just HODL", you stop thinking
about important stuff like keeping your Bitcoin secure and doing your
best to use Bitcoin in a trustless manner.

=== Threats

There are a lot of known weaknesses in Bitcoin, and many of them are
actively being exploited. To get a glimpse of that, have a look at
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses[the Weaknesses page] on the
Bitcoin wiki. They mention a wide variety of problems, for example
wallet theft and denial-of-service attacks. 

[quote, Various authors, The Bitcoin wiki]
____
If an attacker attempts to fill the network with clients that they
control, you would then be very likely to connect only to attacker
nodes. Although Bitcoin never uses a count of nodes for anything,
completely isolating a node from the honest network can be helpful in
the execution of other attacks.
____

This type of attack is called a _Sybil attack_, which means that a
single entity controls multiple nodes in a network, to make it appear
as multiple entities.

As the quote also mentions, the Sybil attack is not effective on the
Bitcoin network because there is no voting with nodes or entities, but
with <<one-cpu-one-vote,with computing power>>. However, this flat
structure leaves the system susceptible to carrying out other
attacks. The authors then lists some possible attacks such as
information hiding (often refered to as an eclipse attack), and how
Bitcoin Core implements some heuristic countermeasures against such
attacks.

The above are examples of real threats that need to be taken care of.

[[sabotage]]
To better understand the minds of an adversary, it might be useful to
get a glimpse into how they might operate. A government body named
Office of Strategic Services, that operated during World War II,
conducted espionage, performed sabotage and propaganda, among other
things, wrote a https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184[manual]
for their personnel on how to sabotage. It's title was "Simple
Sabotage Field Manual" and contained concrete tips on how to
infiltrate the enemy to make their lives hard. They range from burning
down warehouses to causing wear to drills to decrease the enemy's
efficiency.

For example, there is a section (<<fig-sabotage-manual>>) about how an
infiltrator can disrupt organizations. It's not hard to see how such
tactics could be used to target the Bitcoin development process (see
<<opensource>>), which is open for anyone to participate in. A
dedicated attacker can keep stalling progress by endless concerns of
irrelevant issues, haggle over precise wordings, attempt to reiterate
already comprehensively addressed discussions. Not only that, the
attacker can also hire a troll army to multiply their effectiveness,
we can call it a social Sybil attack. Using a social Sybil attack,
they can make it look like there's more resistance against a proposed
change than there actually is.

This highlights how a determined state can and will do everything in
their power to destroy their enemy, including breaking it down from
the inside.

Since Bitcoin is a form of money that competes with established fiat
currencies, chances are that states will regard Bitcoin as an enemy.

Eric Voskuil
https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Axiom-of-Resistance[writes
on his Cryptoeconomics wiki page] about what he calls "Axiom of
Resistance":

[quote, Eric Voskuil, Cryptoeconomics wiki]
____
In other words there is an assumption that it is _possible_ for a
system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but
deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to empirical study of
behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.

*One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an
entirely different system than Bitcoin.* If one assumes it is _not
possible_ for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not
make sense in the context of Bitcoin - just as conclusions in
spherical geometry contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be
permissionless or censorship-resistant without the axiom? The
contradiction leads one to make obvious errors in an attempt to
rationalize the conflict.
____

What he's saying is basically that only when one assumes it's possible
to create a system that can't be controlled by states is it meaningful
to try.

This means that to work on Bitcoin, you should accept the Axiom of
Resistance, otherwise you'd better spend your time on other
projects. Accepting that axiom helps in focussing your development
efforts on the real problems at hand: coding around state-level
adversaries. In other words, think adversarially.
