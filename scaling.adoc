== Scaling

image::scaling-banner.jpg[]


In this chapter, we explore how Bitcoin does and does not
scale. We start by looking at how people have reasoned
about scaling in the past. Then, the bulk of this chapter explains various
approaches to scaling Bitcoin, specifically vertical, horizontal,
inward, and layered scaling. Each description is followed by considerations over whether the approach
interferes with Bitcoin's value proposition.

In the Bitcoin space, different people ascribe different definitions to the word "`scale`". Some conceive it as the
increase of the blockchain transaction capacity, others believe it equals to using the
blockchain more efficiently, and others see it as the development of systems on top of Bitcoin.

In the context of Bitcoin, and for this book's purposes, we define scaling as
_increasing Bitcoin's usage capacity without compromising its
censorship resistance_. This definition encompasses several
kinds of changes, for example:

* Making transaction inputs use fewer bytes
* Improving signature verification performance
* Making the peer-to-peer network use less bandwidth
* Transaction batching
* Layered architecture

We'll soon dive into different approaches to scaling, but let's start
with a brief overview of Bitcoin's history within the context of scaling.

=== History

Scaling has been a focal point of discussion since the genesis of Bitcoin. The
very first sentence of the
https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014814.html[very
first email] in response to Satoshi's announcement of the Bitcoin whitepaper on the
Cryptography mailing list was indeed about scaling:

We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your
proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.
____

The conversation in itself might not be very interesting nor accurate, but
it shows that scaling has been a concern from the very beginning.

Discussions over scaling reached their peak interest around 2015-2017, when there were many
different ideas circulating about whether and how to increase the
maximum block size limit. That was a rather uninteresting discussion
about changing a parameter in the source code, a change that didn't
fundamentally solve anything but pushed the problem of scaling
further into the future, building technical debt.

In 2015, a conference called https://scalingbitcoin.org/[Scaling
Bitcoin] was held in Montreal, with a follow-up conference six months
later in Hong Kong and thereafter in a number of other locations around the world. The focus was precisely on how to
address scaling. Many Bitcoin developers and other enthusiasts gathered at these conferences to
discuss various scaling issues and proposals. Most of these
discussions didn't revolve around block size increases but on more long-term
solutions.

After the Hong Kong conference in December 2015, Gregory Maxwell
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html[summarized
his view] on many of the issues that had been debated, starting off with
some general scaling philosophy.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Capacity increases for the Bitcoin system (2015)]
____
With the available technology, there are fundamental trade-offs
between scale and decentralization. If the system is too costly people
will be forced to trust third parties rather than independently
enforcing the system's rules. If the Bitcoin blockchain’s resource
usage, relative to the available technology, is too great, Bitcoin
loses its competitive advantages compared to legacy systems because
validation will be too costly (pricing out many users), forcing trust
back into the system.  If capacity is too low and our methods of
transacting too inefficient, access to the chain for dispute
resolution will be too costly, again pushing trust back into the
system.
____

He speaks about the trade-off between throughput and
decentralization. If you allow for bigger blocks, you will push some
people off the network because they won't have the resources to validate
the blocks anymore. But on the other hand, if access to block space
becomes more expensive, fewer people will be able to afford using it as a
dispute resolution mechanism. In both cases, users are pushed
towards trusted services.

He continues by summarizing the many approaches to scaling presented at the
conference. Among them are more computationally efficient signature
verifications, _segregated witness_ including a block size limit
change, a more space-efficient block propagation mechanism, and
building protocols on top of Bitcoin in layers. Many of these
approaches have since been implemented.

=== Scaling approaches

As hinted above, scaling Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be about
increasing the block size limit or other limits. We now go through some
general approaches to scaling, some of which don't suffer from the
throughput-decentralization trade-off mentioned in the previous
section.

[[verticalscaling]]
==== Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling is the process of increasing the computing resources
of the machines processing data. In the context of Bitcoin, these latter would be
the full nodes, namely the machines that validate the blockchain on behalf of
their users.

The most commonly discussed technique for vertical scaling 
in Bitcoin is the increase in the
block size limit. This would require some full nodes to upgrade their
hardware to keep up with the increasing computational
demands. The downside is that it happens at the cost of
centralization, as was discussed in the previous section and more
in depth in <<fullnodedecentralization>>.

Besides the negative effects on full node decentralization, vertical
scaling might also negatively impact Bitcoin's
mining decentralization (explained in <<minerdecentralization>>) and security in
less obvious ways. Let's have a look at how miners "`should`"
operate. Say a miner mines a block at height 7 and publishes that
block on the Bitcoin network. It will take some time for this block to
reach broad acceptance, which is mainly due to two factors:

* Transfer of the block between peers takes time due to bandwidth
  limitations.
* Validation of the block takes time.

While block 7 is being propagated through the network, many miners are still
mining on top of block 6 because they haven't received and validated
block 7 yet. During this time, if any of these miners finds a new
block at height 7, there will be two competing blocks at that height.
There can only be one block at height 7 (or any other height), which means one of the two candidates
must become stale.

In short, stale blocks happen because it takes time for each block to
propagate, and the longer propagation takes, the higher the
probability of stale blocks.

Suppose that the block size limit is lifted and that the average block
size increases substantially. Blocks would then propagate slower across the
network due to bandwidth limitations and verification time. An increase in propagation time
will also increase the chances of stale blocks.

Miners don't like to have their blocks staled because they'll lose
their block reward, so they will do whatever they can to avoid this
scenario. The measures they can take include:

* Postponing the validation of an incoming block, also known as
  _validationless mining_, further discussed in <<bip66splits>>. Miners can just check the block
  header's proof-of-work and mine on top of it, while in the meantime they download the
  full block and validate it.
* Connecting to a mining pool with greater bandwidth and connectivity.

Validationless mining further undermines
full node decentralization,
as the miner resorts to trusting
incoming blocks, at least temporarily. It also hurts security to some degree because a
portion of the network's computing power is potentially building on an
invalid blockchain, instead of building on the strongest and valid chain.

The second bullet point has a negative effect on
miner decentralization, see <<minerdecentralization>>, because usually
the pools with the best network connectivity and
bandwidth are also the largest, causing miners to gravitate towards a few big pools.

==== Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling refers to techniques that divide the workload
across multiple machines. While this is a prevalent scaling approach
among popular websites and databases, it's not easily done in
Bitcoin.

Many people refer to this Bitcoin scaling approach as _sharding_. Basically, it consists in letting
each full node verify just a portion of the blockchain. Peter Todd
has put a lot of thought into the concept of sharding. He wrote a
https://petertodd.org/2015/why-scaling-bitcoin-with-sharding-is-very-hard[blog
post] explaining sharding in general terms, and also presenting
his own idea called _treechains_. The article is a difficult read,
but Todd makes some points that are quite digestible.

[quote, Peter Todd, Why Scaling Bitcoin With Sharding Is Very Hard (2015)]
____
In sharded systems the “full node defense” doesn’t work, at least
directly. The whole point is that not everyone has all the data, so
you have to decide what happens when it’s not available.
____

Then he presents various ideas on how to tackle sharding, or
horizontal scaling. Towards the end of the post he concludes:

[quote, Peter Todd, Why Scaling Bitcoin With Sharding Is Very Hard (2015)]
____
There’s a big problem though: holy !@#$ is the above complex compared
to Bitcoin! Even the “kiddy” version of sharding - my linearization
scheme rather than zk-SNARKS - is probably one or two orders of
magnitude more complex than using the Bitcoin protocol is right now,
yet right now a huge % of the companies in this space seem to have
thrown their hands up and used centralized API providers
instead. Actually implementing the above and getting it into the hands
of end-users won’t be easy.

On the other hand, decentralization isn’t cheap: using PayPal is one
or two orders of magnitude simpler than the Bitcoin protocol.
____

The conclusion he makes is that sharding _might_ be technically
possible, but it would come at the cost of tremendous complexity. Given
that many users already find Bitcoin too complex and prefer to use
centralized services instead, it's going to be hard to convince them to use
something even more complex.

==== Inward scaling

While horizontal and vertical scaling have historically worked out well
in centralized systems like databases and web servers, they don't seem
to be suitable for a decentralized network like Bitcoin due to their
centralizing effects.

An approach that gets far too little appreciation is what we can call
_inward scaling_, which translates into "`do more with less`". It refers
to the ongoing work constantly done by many developers to optimize the
algorithms already in place, so that we can do more within the existing
limits of the system.

The improvements that have been achieved through inward scaling are
impressive, to say the least. To give you a general idea of the
improvements over the years, Jameson Lopp
https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-core-performance-evolution/[has run
benchmark tests] on blockchain synchronization, comparing many
different versions of Bitcoin Core going back to version 0.8.

.Initial block download performance of various versions of Bitcoin Core. On the Y-axis is the block height synced and on the X-axis is the time it took to sync to that height.
image::Bitcoin-Core-Sync-Performance-1.png[{big-width}]

The different lines represent different versions of Bitcoin Core. The
leftmost line is the latest, i.e. version 0.22, which was 
released in September 2021 and took 396 minutes to fully sync. The 
rightmost one is version 0.8 from November 2013, which took 3452 
minutes. All of this - roughly 10x - improvement is due to inward 
scaling.

The improvements could be categorized as either saving space (RAM, disk,
bandwidth, etc.) or saving computational power. Both categories
contribute to the improvements in the diagram above.

A good example of computational improvement can be found in the
https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1[libsecp256k1] library, which,
among other things, implements the cryptographic primitives needed to
make and verify digital signatures. Pieter Wuille is one of the
contributors to this library, and he wrote a
https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1450471673321381896[Twitter
thread] showcasing the performance improvements achieved through various pull
requests.

The graph shows the trend for two different 64-bit CPU types, namely ARM and x86.
The difference in performance is due to the more specialized instructions
available on x86 compared to the ARM architecture, which has fewer and
more generic instructions. However, the general trend is the same for both
architectures. Note that the Y-axis is logarithmic, which makes the
improvements look less impressive than they actually are.

There are also several good examples of space-saving improvements that contributed to
performance enhancement. In a
https://murchandamus.medium.com/2-of-3-multisig-inputs-using-pay-to-taproot-d5faf2312ba3[Medium
blog post] about Taproot's contribution to saving space, user Murch
compares how much block space a 2-of-3 threshold signature would
require, using Taproot in various ways as well as not using it at all.

.Space savings for different spending types, Taproot and legacy versions.
image::murch-taproot.png[{half-width}]

A 2-of-3 multisig using native Segwit would require a total of
104.5+43 vB = 147.5 vB, whereas the most space-conservative use of Taproot
would require only 57.5+43 vB = 100.5
vB in the standard use case. At worst and in rare cases, like when a standard signer is
not available for some reason, Taproot would use 107.5+43 vB = 150.5 vB. You don't have
to understand all the details, but this should give you an idea
of how developers think about saving space - every little byte counts.

Apart from inward scaling in Bitcoin software, there are
some ways in which users can contribute to inward scaling, too. They can
make their transactions more intelligently to save on
transaction fees while simultaneously decreasing their footprints on
full node requirements. Two commonly used techniques toward such goal are called
transaction batching and output consolidation.

The idea with transaction batching is to combine multiple payments
into one single transaction, instead of making one transaction per
payment. This can save you a lot of fees, and at the same time reduce
the block space load.

.Transaction batching combines multiple payments into a single transaction to save on fees.
image::tx-batching.png[{big-width}]

Output consolidation refers to taking advantage of periods of low demand for
block space to combine multiple outputs into a single output. This
can reduce your fee cost later, when you'll need to make a payment while the
demand for block space is high.

.Output consolidation. Melt your coins into one big coin when fees are low to save fees later.
image::utxo-consolidation.png[{big-width}]

It may not be obvious how output consolidation contributes to inward
scaling. After all, the total amount of blockchain data is even slightly
increased with this method. Nonetheless, the UTXO set, i.e. the database that keeps
track of who owns which coins, shrinks because you spend more UTXOs
than you create. This alleviates the burden for full nodes to maintain
their UTXO sets.

Unfortunately, however, these two techniques of _UTXO management_ could
be bad for your own or your payees`' privacy. In the batching case, each
payee will know that all the batched outputs are from you to other payees
(except possibly the change). In the UTXO consolidation case, you will
reveal that the outputs you consolidate belong to the same wallet. So
you may have to make a trade-off between cost efficiency and privacy.

[[layeredscaling]]
==== Layered scaling

The most impactful approach to scaling is probably layering. The
general idea behind layering is that a protocol can settle payments
between users without adding transactions to the blockchain.
This was already discussed briefly in <<trustlessness>> and
<<privacymeasures>>.

A layered protocol begins with two or more people agreeing
on a start transaction that's put on the blockchain, as illustrated in
<<fig-scaling-layer>>.

[[fig-scaling-layer]]
.A typical layer 2 protocol on top of Bitcoin, layer 1.
image::scaling-layer.png[]

How this start transaction is created varies between protocols, but a 
common theme is that the participants create an unsigned start 
transaction and a number of pre-signed punishment
transactions, that spend the output of the start transaction in various 
ways. Subsequently, the start transaction is fully signed and published to the 
blockchain, and the punishment transactions can be fully signed and 
published to punish a misbehaving party. This 
incentivizes the participants to keep their promises so that the 
protocol can work in a trustless way.

Once the start transaction is on the blockchain, the protocol can do
what it's supposed to do. For instance, it could do super fast payments between
participants, implement some privacy-enhancing techniques, or do more
advanced scripting that would not be supported by the Bitcoin blockchain.

We won't detail how specific protocols work, but as
you can see in <<fig-scaling-layer>>, the blockchain is rarely used
during the protocol's life cycle. All the juicy action happens
_off-chain_. We've seen how this can be a win for privacy
if done right, but it can also be an advantage for scalability.

In a https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/[Reddit post] titled "`A trip to the moon requires a rocket with
multiple stages or otherwise the rocket equation will eat your
lunch... packing everyone in clown-car style into a trebuchet and
hoping for success is right out.`", Gregory Maxwell explains why
layering is our best shot at getting Bitcoin to scale by orders of
magnitudes.

He starts by emphasizing the fallacy in viewing Visa or Mastercard as
Bitcoin's main competitors and highlighting how increasing the maximum block size
is a bad approach to meet said competition. Then he talks about
how to make some real difference by using layers.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin on Reddit (2016)]
____
So-- Does that mean that Bitcoin can't be a big winner as a payments
technology? No. But to reach the kind of capacity required to serve
the payments needs of the world we must work more intelligently.

From its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in
secure ways through its smart contracting capability (What, do you
think that was just put there so people could wax-philosophic about
meaningless "DAOs"?). In effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a
highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct
most of our business outside of the court room-- but transact in such
a way that if something goes wrong we have all the evidence and
established agreements so we can be confident that the robotic court
will make it right. (Geek sidebar: If this seems impossible, go read
this old post on transaction cut-through)

This is possible precisely because of the core properties of
Bitcoin. A censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable
to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of... and
if the underlying asset isn't sound, there is little point in
transacting with it at all.
____

The analogy with the judge is quite illustrative of how layering
works: this judge must be incorruptible and never change her
mind, otherwise the layers above Bitcoin's base layer will not work
reliably.

He continues by making a point about centralized services. There's usually no
problem with trusting a central server with trivial amounts of Bitcoin
to get things done: that's also layered scaling.

Many years have passed since Maxwell wrote the piece above, and his
words still stand correct. The success of the Lightning Network proves
that layering is indeed a way forward to increase the utility of
Bitcoin.


=== Conclusion

We've discussed various ways through which one might want to scale
Bitcoin, increase Bitcoin's usage capacity. Scaling has been a concern
in Bitcoin since its very early days.

We know today that Bitcoin doesn't scale well vertically ("`buy bigger
hardware`") or horizontally ("`verify only parts of the data`"), but
rather inward ("`do more with less`") and in layers ("`build protocols
on top of Bitcoin`").
