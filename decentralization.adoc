== Decentralization

image::decentralization-banner.jpg[]

This chapter analyzes what decentralization is and why it's
essential for Bitcoin to function. We distinguish between the
decentralization of miners and that of full nodes, and discuss what
they bring to the table for censorship resistance, one of Bitcoin's
most central properties. The discussion then shifts
to understanding neutrality - or permissionlessness towards users,
miners, and developers - which is a necessary property of any
decentralized system. Lastly, we touch upon how hard it can be to
grasp a decentralized system like Bitcoin, and present some mental
models that might help you grok it.

A system without any central point of control is referred to as being
_decentralized_. Bitcoin is designed to avoid having a central point
of control, or more precisely a _central point of censorship_.
Decentralization is a means to achieve _censorship resistance_.

There are two major aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin: miner
decentralization and full node decentralization. Miner
decentralization refers to the fact that transaction processing isn't performed nor
coordinated by any central entity. Full node decentralization refers to the fact that
validation of the blocks, i.e. the data that miners output, gets done at
the edge of the network, ultimately by its users, and not by a few
trusted authorities.

=== Miner decentralization

There had been attempts at creating digital currencies before Bitcoin,
but most of them failed due to a lack of governance decentralization
and censorship resistance.

Miner decentralization in Bitcoin means that the _ordering of
transactions_ isn't carried out by any single entity or fixed set of
entities. It's carried out collectively by all the actors who want
to participate in it; this miners`' collective is a dynamic set of users. Anyone can
join or leave as they wish. This property makes Bitcoin censorship-resistant.

If Bitcoin were centralized, it would be vulnerable to those who
wished to censor it, such as governments. It would meet the same fate
as earlier attempts to create digital money. In the introduction of
https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf[a paper] titled "`Enabling
Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains`", the authors explain
how early versions of digital money weren't equipped for an
adversarial environment (see also <<adversarialthinking>>):

[quote, various authors, Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains (2014)]
____
David Chaum introduced digital cash as a research topic in 1983, in a
setting with a central server that is trusted to prevent
double-spending[Cha83]. To mitigate the privacy risk to individuals
from this central trusted party, and to enforce fungibility, Chaum
introduced the blind signature, which he used to provide a
cryptographic means to prevent linking of the central server’s
signatures (which represent coins), while still allowing the central
server to perform double-spend prevention. The requirement for a
central server became the Achilles’ heel of digital cash[Gri99]. While
it is possible to distribute this single point of failure by replacing
the central server’s signature with a threshold signature of several
signers, it is important for auditability that the signers be distinct
and identifiable. This still leaves the system vulnerable to failure,
since each signer can fail, or be made to fail, one by one.
____

It became clear that using a central server to order transactions was
not a viable option due to the high risk of censorship. Even if one
replaced the central server with a federation of a fixed set of
n servers, of which at least m must
approve of an ordering, there would still be difficulties. The problem would indeed 
shift to one where users must agree on this set of n servers 
as well as on how to replace malicious servers with good ones without relying on a central authority.

Let's contemplate what could happen if Bitcoin were censorable. The
censor could pressure users to identify themselves, to
declare where their money is coming from or what they're buying with it
before allowing their transactions to enter the blockchain.

Also, the lack of censorship resistance would allow the censor to
coerce users into adopting new system rules. For example, they could
impose a change that allowed them to inflate the money supply, thereby enriching
themselves. In such an event, a user verifying blocks would have three
options to handle the new rules:

* Adopt: Accept the changes and adopt them into their full node.
* Reject: Refuse to adopt the changes; this leaves the user with a system that doesn't process
transactions anymore, as the censor's blocks are now deemed invalid
by the user's full node.
* Move: Appoint a new central point of control; all of the users must figure out how
to coordinate and then agree on the new central control point.
If they succeed, the same issues will most likely resurface at some point in the future, considering that the system
remained just as censorable as it was before.

None of these options are beneficial to the user.

Censorship resistance through decentralization is what separates Bitcoin from
other money systems, but it is not an easy thing to accomplish due to
the _double-spending problem_. This is the problem of making sure no
one can spend the same coin twice, an issue that many people thought was
impossible to solve in a decentralized fashion. Satoshi Nakamoto
write in his https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin whitepaper] about how
to solve the double-spending problem:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008)]
____
In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem
using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate
computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
____

Here he uses the peculiar-sounding phrase "`peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
server`". The keyword here is _distributed_, which in this
context means that there is no central point of control. Nakamoto then
goes on to explain how proof-of-work is the solution. Still, no one
explains it better than
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/[Gregory
Maxwell on Reddit], where he responds to someone who proposes to limit
miners`' hash power to avoid potential 51% attacks:

[[one-cpu-one-vote]]
[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit (2019)]
____
A decentralized system like Bitcoin uses a public election. But you
can't just have a vote of 'people' in a decentralized system because
that would require a centralized party to authorize people to
vote. Instead, Bitcoin uses a vote of computing power because it's
possible to verify computing power without the help of any centralized
third party.
____

The post explains how the decentralized Bitcoin network can come to an
agreement on transaction ordering through the use of proof-of-work.
He then concludes by saying that the 51% attack is not particularly
worrisome, compared to people not caring about or not
understanding Bitcoin's decentralization properties.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit (2019)]
____
A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won't
understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization
properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the
first place.
____

The conclusion is an important one. If people don't protect Bitcoin's
decentralization, which is a proxy for its censorship resistance, Bitcoin
might fall victim to centralizing powers, until it's so centralized
that censorship becomes a thing. Then most, if not all, of its value
proposition is gone. This brings us to the next section on full node
decentralization.

[[fullnodedecentralization]]
=== Full node decentralization

In the paragraphs above, we've mostly talked about miner decentralization and how
centralizating miners can allow for censorship. But there's also another
aspect of decentralization, namely _full node decentralization_.

The importance of full node decentralization is related to
trustlessness (see <<trustlessness>>). Suppose a user stops running their own
full node due to, for example, a prohibitive increase in the cost of
operation. In that case, they have to interact with the Bitcoin network in some
other way, possibly by using web wallets or lightweight wallets, which requires a certain level of trust in the providers of these services.
The user goes from directly enforcing the network consensus rules to trusting that
someone else will. Now suppose that most users delegate consensus enforcement to a
trusted entity. In that case, the network can quickly spiral into centralization, and the
network rules can be changed by conspiring malicious actors.

In
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralist-perspective-bitcoin-might-need-small-blocks-1442090446[a
Bitcoin Magazine article], Aaron van Wirdum interviews Bitcoin
developers about their views on decentralization and the risks
involved in increasing Bitcoin's maximum block size. This discussion
was a hot topic during the 2014-2017 era, when many people argued over
increasing the block size limit to allow for more transaction
throughput.

A powerful argument against increasing the block size is that it
increases the cost of verification (see <<verticalscaling,the
Scaling chapter>>). If verification cost rises, it will push some 
users to stop running their full nodes. This, in turn, will lead to
more people not being able to use the system in a
trustless way. Pieter Wuille is quoted in the article, where he
explains the risks of full node centralization.

[quote, Pieter Wuille, The Decentralist Perspective or Why Bitcoin Might Need Small Blocks (2015)]
____
If lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be
convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the
decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules
their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance
because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or
mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities
can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything
that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.
____

There you go. Bitcoin users should run their own full
nodes to deter regulators and big corporations from trying to change
the consensus rules.

[[neutrality]]
=== Neutrality

Bitcoin is neutral, or permissionless, as people like to call it. This
means that Bitcoin doesn't care who you are or what you use it for.

[quote, wumpus on freenode IRC (punctuation added), #bitcoin-core-dev 2012-04-04T17:34:04 UTC]
____
bitcoin is neutral, which is a good thing, and the only way it can
work. if it was controlled by an organisation it'd just be another
virtual object type and I would have zero interest in it
____

As long as you play by the rules, you're free to use it
as you please, without asking anyone for permission. This includes
_mining_, _transacting_ in, and _building protocols and services_ on top of
Bitcoin.

* If *mining* were a permissioned process, we would need a
central authority to select who's allowed to mine. This would most
likely lead to miners having to sign legal contracts in which they would agree
to censor transactions according to the whims of the central
authority, which defeats the purpose of mining in the first place.

* If people *transacting* in Bitcoin had to provide personal
information, declare what their transactions were for, or otherwise prove
that they were worthy of transacting, we would also need a central
point of authority to approve users or transactions. Again,
this would lead to censorship and exclusion.

* If developers had to ask for permission to *build protocols* on top of
Bitcoin, only the protocols allowed by the central developer granting committee
would get developed. This would, due to government intervention,
inevitably exclude all privacy-preserving protocols and all attempts
at improving decentralization.

At all levels, trying to impose restrictions on who gets to use
Bitcoin for what will hurt Bitcoin to the point where it's no longer
living up to its value proposition.

Pieter Wuille https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/92055/69518[answers
a question on Stack Exchange] about how the blockchain relates to
normal databases. He explains how permissionlessness is achievable
through the use of proof-of-work in combination with economic
incentives. He concludes:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange (2019)]
____
Using trustless consensus algorithms like PoW does add something no
other construction gives you (permissionless participation, meaning
there is no set group of participants that can censor your changes),
but comes at a high cost, and its economic assumptions make it pretty
much only useful for systems that define their own
cryptocurrency. There is probably only place in the world for one or a
few actually used ones of these.
____

He explains that, in order to achieve permissionlessness, the system most
likely needs its own currency, thereby "`limiting the use cases to
effectively just cryptocurrencies`". This is because permissionless
participation, or mining, requires economic incentives built into the
system itself.

=== Grokking decentralization

A compelling aspect of Bitcoin is how hard it is to grasp
that no one controls it. There are no committees or executives in
Bitcoin. Gregory Maxwell, again
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/s82t2n/comment/htdte7w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[on
the Bitcoin subreddit], compares this to the English language in an
intriguing way:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit (2022)]
____
Many people have a hard time understanding autonomous systems, there
are many in their lives things like the english language-- but people
just take them for granted and don't even think of them as
systems. They're stuck in a centralized way of thinking where
everything they think of as a 'thing' has an authority that
controls it.

Bitcoin doesn't focus on anything. Various people who have adopted
Bitcoin chose of their own free will to promote it, and how they
choose to do so is their own business. Authority fixated people may
see these activities and believe they're some operation by the bitcoin
authority, but no such authority exists.
____

.Fish schools have no leaders.

The way Bitcoin works through decentralization resembles the
extraordinary collective intelligence found among many species in
nature. Computer scientist Radhika Nagpal speaks in a
https://www.ted.com/talks/radhika_nagpal_what_intelligent_machines_can_learn_from_a_school_of_fish[Ted
talk] about the collective behavior of fish schools and how scientists are trying
to mimic it using robots.

[quote, Radhika Nagpal, What intelligent machines can learn from a school of fish (2017)]
____
Secondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable, is that we
know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school. Instead,
this incredible collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the
interactions of one fish and another. Somehow, there are these
interactions or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make
it all work out.
____

She points out that many systems, either natural or artificial, can and do
work without leaders, and they are powerful and resilient. Each individual only
interacts with their immediate surroundings, but together they form something
tremendous.

No matter what you think about Bitcoin, its decentralized nature makes
it difficult to control. Bitcoin exists, and there's nothing you can do
about it. It's something to be studied, not debated.

=== Conclusion

We distinguish between full node decentralization and mining
decentralization. Mining decentralization is a means to achieve
censonship resistance, while full node decentralization is what keeps
the consensus rules of the network hard to change without broad
support among users.

The decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows for neutrality towards
developers, users, and miners. Anyone is free to participate without
asking for permission.

Decentralized systems can be hard to wrap your head around, but there
are some mental models that may help, for example the English
language, or fish schools.
