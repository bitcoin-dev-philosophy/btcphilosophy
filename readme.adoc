== About btcphilosophy

This project is a guide for new bitcoin developers to learn about
the digital currency's fundamental properties and how seasoned Bitcoin
developers think about them.

This guide should provide the reader with a solid, technical
philosophical foundation from which to further explore this
fascinating subject. After reading this collection of articles,
you'll:

* have cruised over a decade of Bitcoin development history
* be able to distinguish useful Bitcoin ideas from, well, less useful ideas
* get accustomed to some great places for Bitcoin information
* be humbled by the vast amount of wisdom available
* be humbled by the breadth of this field

=== Intended reader

This guide is intended for the developer who just started digging into
Bitcoin development or has worked in the Bitcoin space in one form or
the other.

The reader doesn't have to know all the ins and outs of Bitcoin, but
should understand how it operates on a high level. For example, the
following should be clear to the reader beforehand:

* What proof-of-work is
* How blocks are interconnected
* Lifecycle of transactions

=== How is this organized?

The project is sectioned into topics. Each topic will guide you
through a number of links to articles or videos, that we recommend
reading and briefly discuss each link. The material presented is
written by individuals who have studied Bitcoin development for a long time.

The links refer to external resources on platforms we can't
control. We have therefore saved the linked articles locally in this
repository, along with info on where it was copied from, and when. The
resources are collected in link:sources/sources.html[a separate document]
(`sources/sources.adoc`) organized by the chapter they are linked
from.

The links throughout the chapters refer to the original sources, but
if you don't have an internet connection, the links appear dead, or
the content seems severely changed, you can read the content locally
instead.

=== What to expect

There are lots of people involved in Bitcoin; some have opposing opinions,
there are resources that express contradictory ideas. However, we will
attempt to stick to the facts, where opinions do not matter.

Bitcoin is a huge subject. We cannot cover all it's aspects, but we
hope that we've discussed enough of it to get you started, and that
you'll be able to explore further on your own.

=== Build

The book is written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. To build
this book, clone the GitHub repository:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/btcphilosophy.git
$ cd btcphilosophy
----

and then build using `asciidoctor`:

----
$ asciidoctor -v btcphilosophy.adoc
----

The `-v` flag is recommended and instructs asciidoctor to be verbose,
which means it will show invalid references and other issues. The
above command will result in a file `btcphilosophy.html` in your
current directory that you can view in any browser, for example:

----
$ brave-browser btcphilosophy.html
----

The source material is collected and maintained as a separate book
under the `sources` folder. To build it:

----
$ asciidoctor -v sources/sources.adoc
----

This will result in a file `sources/sources.html` that you can open in
a web browser in the same way as the main book.

=== Who wrote this?

The main authors are Kalle Rosenbaum and Linn√©a Rosenbaum. This work
is commissioned and funded by Chaincode Labs. Chaincode Labs runs internships
for developers where the attendants learn about Bitcoin development.
