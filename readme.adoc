== About this book

_Bitcoin Development Philosophy_ is a guide for Bitcoin developers
who already understand the basics of concepts and processes such as Proof-of-Work, block
building, and the transaction life cycle, and who want to level up by
gaining a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's design trade-offs and
philosophy. It should help new developers absorb the most important
lessons of over a decade of Bitcoin development and public debate, while providing them with
a useful context for evaluating new ideas (good ones and bad ones!).

=== What to expect?

As stated above, this is a practical guide for Bitcoin developers. However, Bitcoin is a broad and complex subject and we couldn't possibly cover all of its aspects here. With this book, we
hope to discuss the necessary features to get your development activity started as well as to enable you to further explore it on your own.

There are lots of people involved in Bitcoin; as some of them have opposing opinions, here you may find
resources that express contradictory ideas. However, we always
attempt to stick to the domain of facts, where opinions do not matter.

=== How is this organized?

The book is sectioned into chapters, each covering a pivotal topic within Bitcoin. Every
chapter guides you through the relevant information related to the chapter's focus, with the addition of links and QR codes that will take you to articles or
videos that we recommend reading or watching. The reported material was written by individuals who have
studied Bitcoin development for a long time.

The links refer to external resources on platforms we cannot
control. We have therefore saved the linked articles locally in this
repository, along with the information on where it was copied from and when. The
resources are collected in link:sources/sources.html[a separate
document] (`sources/sources.adoc`) and organized by the chapter they are
linked to. The links found in the chapters refer to the original
sources, which should be found online, but in case you don't have an internet connection, the links
appear dead, or the information seems severely changed, you can read the
content locally instead.
