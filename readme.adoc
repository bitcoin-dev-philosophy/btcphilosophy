== About this book

_Bitcoin Development Philosophy_ is a guide for new Bitcoin developers
who already understand the basics of, for example proof of work, block
building, and the transaction life cycle, who want to level-up and
gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's design tradeoffs and
philosophy. It should help new developers absorb the most important
lessons of a decade of bitcoin development and discussion, and provide
a context for evaluating new ideas (good ones and bad ones!).

=== How is this organized?

The project is sectioned into chapters of different topics. Each
chapter will guide you through a number of links to articles or
videos, that we recommend reading, and will briefly discuss each
link. The material presented is written by individuals who have
studied Bitcoin development for a long time.

The links refer to external resources on platforms we can't
control. We have therefore saved the linked articles locally in this
repository, along with info on where it was copied from, and when. The
resources are collected in link:sources/sources.html[a separate
document] (`sources/sources.adoc`) organized by the chapter they are
linked from.

The links throughout the chapters refer to the original sources, but
if you don't have an internet connection, the links appear dead, or
the content seems severely changed, you can read the content locally
instead.

=== What to expect

There are lots of people involved in Bitcoin; some have opposing opinions,
there are resources that express contradictory ideas. However, we will
attempt to stick to the facts, where opinions do not matter.

Bitcoin is a huge subject. We cannot cover all its aspects, but we
hope that we've discussed enough of it to get you started, and that
you'll be able to explore further on your own.

=== Who wrote this?

The main authors are Kalle Rosenbaum and Linn√©a Rosenbaum. This work
is commissioned and funded by Chaincode Labs. Chaincode Labs runs internships
for developers where the attendants learn about Bitcoin development.
