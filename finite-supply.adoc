== Finite supply

image::finitesupply-banner.jpg[]

This chapter looks into the bitcoin supply limit of 21 million BTC, or
how much is it actually? We talk about how this limit is enforced
and what one can do to verify that it's being respected. Moreover, we
take a peek into the crystal ball and discuss the dynamics
that will come into play when the block reward shifts from
subsidy-based to fee-based.

The well-known finite supply of 21 million BTC is regarded as a
fundamental property of Bitcoin. But is it really set in stone?

Let's start by looking at what the current consensus rules say about
the supply of bitcoin, and how much of it will actually be
usable. Pieter Wuille wrote a piece about this
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/38998/69518[on Stack Exchange],
in which he counted how many bitcoins there would be once all coins are
mined:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange (2015)]
____
If you sum all these numbers together, you get *20999999.9769* BTC.
____

But due to a number of reasons -- such as early problems with coinbase
transactions, miners who unintentionally claim less than allowed, and
loss of private keys -- that upper limit will never be reached. Wuille
concludes:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange (2015)]
____
This leaves us with *20999817.31308491* BTC (taking everything up to
block 528333 into account)

//noqr
\... However, various wallets have been lost or stolen, transactions
have been sent to the wrong address, people forgot they owned
bitcoin. The totals of this may well be millions. People have tried to
tally known losses up

This leaves us with: *???* BTC.

We can thus be sure that the bitcoin supply will be
20999817.31308491 BTC at most. Any lost or unverifiably burnt coins will make
this number lower, but we don't know by how much. The interesting
thing is that it doesn't really matter, or better yet it does matter in a
positive way for bitcoin holders,
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.msg1647#msg1647[as
explained] by Satoshi Nakamoto:

[quote,Satoshi Nakamoto on lost bitcoins, Bitcointalk forum (2010)]
____
Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think
of it as a donation to everyone.
____

The finite supply will shrink and this should, at least in theory,
cause price deflation.

More important than the exact number of coins in circulation is
the way the supply limit is enforced without any central
authority. Alias chytrik puts it well on
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/106830/69518[Stack Exchange].

[quote, chytrik, Stack Exchange (2021)]
____
So the answer is that you don't have to trust someone to not increase
the supply. You just have to run some code that will verify that they
haven't.
____

Even if some full nodes turn to the dark side and decide to
accept blocks with higher-value coinbase transactions, all the remaining full
nodes will simply neglect them and continue doing business as usual. Some full nodes
may, intentionally or unintentionally (see
<<combined-output-overflow>>), run evil
softwares, yet the collective will robustly secure the blockchain.
In conclusion, you can choose to trust the system without having to
trust anyone.

=== Block subsidy and transaction fees

A block reward is composed of the block subsidy plus transaction
fees. The block reward needs to cover Bitcoin's security costs. We can
say for sure that under today's conditions with regard to block subsidy, transaction fees,
bitcoin price, mempool size, hash power, degree of decentralization
etc., the incentives for every player to play by the rules are high enough to preserve a
secure monetary system.

What happens when the block subsidy approaches zero? To keep things simple, let's
assume it actually equals zero. At this point, the system's security cost
is covered through transaction fees only. What the future holds
for us when this happens, we cannot know. The uncertainty factors are
numerous and we are left to speculations. For example, Paul Sztorc's
contribution to the subject
https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/[in his Truthcoin
blog] is mostly speculations, but he has at least one solid point (please note that M2,
as referred to by Sztorc, is a measurement of a fiat money supply):

[quote, 'Paul Sztorc, Security Budget in the Long Run', Truthcoin blog (2019)]
____
While the two are mixed into the same “security budget”, the block
subsidy and txn-fees are utterly and completely different. They are as
different from each other, as “VISA’s total profits in 2017” are from
the “total increase in M2 in 2017”.
____

Today, it is holders who pay for security (via monetary inflation). Tomorrow
it will be the spenders`' turn to somehow shoulder this burden, as
illustrated below.

.As time goes by, the bearing of security costs will shift from holders to spenders.

When transaction fees are the main motivation for mining, the
incentives shift. Most notably, if the mempool of a miner doesn't
contain enough transaction fees, it might become more profitable for
that miner to rewrite Bitcoin's history rather than
extending it. Bitcoin Optech has a specific
https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/fee-sniping/[section on this
behavior], called _fee sniping_, written by David Harding:

//noqr
[quote,"David Harding, fee sniping", Bitcoin Optech website]
____
Fee sniping is a problem that may occur as Bitcoin’s subsidy continues
to diminish and transaction fees begin to dominate Bitcoin’s block
rewards. If transaction fees are all that matter, then a miner with
`x` percent of the hash rate has a `x` percent chance of mining the
next block, so the expected value to them of honestly mining is `x`
percent of the
https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/06/02/#candidate-set-based-csb-block-template-construction[best
feerate set of transactions] in their mempool.

Alternatively, a miner could dishonestly attempt to re-mine the
previous block plus a wholly new block to extend the chain. This
behavior is referred to as fee sniping, and the dishonest miner’s
chance of succeeding at it if every other miner is honest is
`(x/(1-x))^2`. Even though fee sniping has an overall lower probability
of success than honest mining, attempting dishonest mining could be
the more profitable choice if transactions in the previous block paid
significantly higher feerates than the transactions currently in the
mempool—a small chance at a large amount can be worth more than a
large chance at a small amount.
____

Throwing a wet blanket over our hopes for the future is the fact that if miners start
conducting fee sniping, this will incentivize others to do the same,
leaving even fewer honest miners. This could severely impair the
overall security of Bitcoin. Harding goes on to list a few
countermeasures that can be taken, such as relying on transaction
time locks to restrict where in the blockchain the transaction may
appear.

So, given that the consensus on finite supply remains, the block
subsidy will - thanks to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki[BIP42]
which fixed a very-long-term inflation bug - get to zero around year
2140. Will the transaction fees thereafter be enough to secure the
network? It's impossible to say, but we do know a few things:

* A century is a _long_ time from the Bitcoin perspective. If it is
  still around, it will have probably evolved enormously.
* If an overwhelming economic majority finds it necessary to change
  the rules and introduce for example a perpetual annual 0.1% or 1%
  monetary inflation, the supply of bitcoin will no longer be finite.
* With zero block subsidy and an empty or nearly empty mempool, things
  can become shaky due to fee sniping.

Since the transition to a fee-only block reward is so far in the future, it
might be wise not to jump to conclusions and try to fix the potential
issues while we can. For example, Peter Todd thinks there's an actual risk that Bitcoin's
security budget won't be enough in the future, and consequently argues for a small
perpetual inflation in Bitcoin. However, he also thinks it's not a
good idea to discuss such an issue at this time, as
https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/peter-todd-on-the-essence-of-bitcoin[he said on the What
Bitcoin Did podcast]:

[quote,Peter Todd on security budget, What Bitcoin Did podcast (2019)]
____
But, that’s a risk like 10, 20 years in the future. That is a very
long time. And, by then, who the hell knows what the risks are?
____

Perhaps we could think of Bitcoin as something organic. Imagine a
small, slowly-growing oak plant. Imagine also that you have never seen a fully
grown tree in your life. Wouldn't it be wise then to restrain your
control issues instead of setting in advance all the rules on how this plant
should be allowed to evolve and grow?

=== Conclusion

Whether the bitcoin supply will grow past 21 million we cannot say
today, and that is probably not so bad. Ensuring that the security
budget remains high enough is crucial but not urgent. Let's have this
discussion in 10-50 years, when we know more. If it's still relevant.
